## Diagnostics


### Nose-throat scope

Nose-throat testing can be done by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist or similar head-neck specialist:

- [ ] Test for GIRD, acid reflux, structural abnormalities, etc. 

  - Typically this can be done by using a nose-throat scope during a routine office visit.

If testing turns up acid issues:

- [ ] Rx antacid, such as Famotidine, a.k.a. brand name Pepcid.

  - In addition to decreasing acid, famotidine is a histamine-2 blocker (H2 blocker).

If testing turns up structural anomalies:

- [ ] Do a head-neck CT scan with contrast. 

  - This is to rule out problems such as throat cancer.


### Gut tox screen

Gut toxin screening by an internal medicine specialist or similar immunology specialist.

Aim for comprehensive testing of GI toxins:

- [ ] Test for mycotoxins in urine. 

  - A comprehensive test includes 40+ items.

## Allergy testing

Allergy testing a.k.a. histamine-response testing can be done by an allergy specialist or similar immunology specialist.

- [ ] Do comprehensive skin prick panels for flora, fauna, chemicals, etc.

  - This includes 400+ items. 

  - This is more comprehensive and more accurate than typical allergy blood tests.

  - This is best done after a week or so without taking any antihistamines, because antihistimes tend to interfere with the skin prick testing.


## Gut cleanse

Gut bile cleaning via bile acid sequestrants.

- [ ] Cholestyramine (Rx) is a popular choice.

- [ ] Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol) (Rx) is a similar choice, and may be better-tolerated.

- [ ] Activated charcoal (OTC) is a similar choice, and may be stronger and faster.

Estimate 2-4 weeks to feel results.
