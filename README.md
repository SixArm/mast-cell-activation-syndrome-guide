## Diagnostics


### Nose-throat scope

Nose-throat testing can be done by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist or similar head-neck specialist:

- [ ] Test for GIRD, acid reflux, structural abnormalities, etc. 

  - Typically this can be done by using a nose-throat scope during a routine office visit.

If testing turns up acid issues:

- [ ] Rx antacid, such as famotidine (a.k.a. brand name Pepcid).

  - In addition to decreasing acid, famotidine is a histamine-2 blocker (H2 blocker).

If testing turns up structural anomalies:

- [ ] Do a head-neck CT scan with contrast. 

  - This is to rule out problems such as throat cancer.


### Gut tox screen

Gut toxin screening by an internal medicine specialist or similar immunology specialist.

Aim for comprehensive testing of GI toxins:

- [ ] Test for mycotoxins in urine. 

  - A comprehensive test includes 40+ items. 

  - A company that offers this testing is [Mosaic DX](https://mosaicdx.com)

### Histamine symptom management

Daily medications:

- [ ] Montelukast (a.k.a. brand name Singulair) (Rx)

- [ ] Morning & evening H1 + H2 oral antihistamines (OTC)

- [ ] Morning & evening nasal sprays

Also:

- [ ] Adrenaline (a.ka. epinephrine) emergency auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen)


### Anti-fungal herbal agents

[5 Herbal Agents for Antifungal Therapy](https://mosaicdx.com/resource/5-herbal-agents-for-antifungal-therapy/)

- [ ] Goldenseal a.k.a. Hydrastis canadensis

- [ ] Black Walnut a.k.a. Juglans nigra

- [ ] Echinacea a.k.a. Echinacea purpurea

- [ ] Grapefruit seed extract

- [ ] Garlic a.k.a. Allium sativum


## Allergy testing

Allergy testing a.k.a. histamine-response testing can be done by an allergy specialist or similar immunology specialist.

- [ ] Do comprehensive skin prick panels for flora, fauna, chemicals, etc.

  - This includes 400+ items. 

  - This is more comprehensive and more accurate than typical allergy blood tests.

  - This is best done after a week or so without taking any antihistamines, because antihistimes tend to interfere with the skin prick testing.


## Gut cleanse

Gut bile cleaning via bile acid sequestrants.

- [ ] Cholestyramine (Rx) is a popular choice.

- [ ] Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol) (Rx) is a similar choice, and may be better-tolerated.

- [ ] Activated charcoal (OTC) is a similar choice, and may be stronger and faster.

Estimate 2-4 weeks to feel results.
