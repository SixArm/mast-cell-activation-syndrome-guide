If you react to marshmallows, it’s probably gelatin that’s to blame. Gelatin is a protein and, although rare, it can lead to allergic reactions. You might experience hives, an itchy mouth or throat, mouth swelling, or stomach ache.

Gelatin is also found in gummy sweets.

Gelatin issues have been linked to vaccines such as the flu shot.
