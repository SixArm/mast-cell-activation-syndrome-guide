# Low-allergen diet: foods to avoid

For a low-allergen diet, here are foods to avoid or limit:

* Foods known to be common allergens, often referred to as the "big eight".  These include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

* Highly Allergenic Ingredients: Avoid foods containing highly allergenic ingredients like casein, lactose, gluten, and soy derivatives.

* Processed and Prepackaged Foods: Many processed and prepackaged foods can contain hidden allergens. It's advisable to focus on whole, unprocessed foods to minimize exposure to hidden allergens.

* Artificial Additives: Some food additives, such as artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, can trigger allergic reactions or intolerances in some individuals.

* Cross-Contamination: Be vigilant about cross-contamination, which can occur when allergenic foods come into contact with other foods or food preparation surfaces. This is especially important for people with severe allergies.
