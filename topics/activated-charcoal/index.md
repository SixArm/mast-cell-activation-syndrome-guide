# Activated charcoal

Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon, is a form of carbon that has been processed to have a large surface area, making it highly adsorbent. It is commonly used for its ability to adsorb (bind to) a wide range of substances, including toxins, chemicals, and impurities.

**Key points:**

* **Medical use**: It treats certain types of poisoning or overdose, by binding to the toxic substances in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream, and facilitating their elimination from the body.

* **Over-the-Counter products**: Activated charcoal is available over the counter in various forms, such as capsules and powder. Some people use it as a dietary supplement or for digestive issues.

* **Side effects:** When taken internally, it can also lead to potential side effects, including constipation, black stools, and gastrointestinal discomfort. It can also interfere with the absorption of medications and nutrients when taken internally.

* **Teeth whitening**: Activated charcoal is sometimes used in dental products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash, as a potential teeth-whitening agent.
  
* **Skin Care**: Some skin care products, including face masks and cleansers, contain activated charcoal. It is believed to help remove impurities from the skin and unclog pores.

* **Purification**: Activated charcoal is used in water purification systems and air filters to remove impurities, chemicals, and odors. It is known for its high adsorption capacity.
