# Activated charcoal
Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon, is a form of carbon that has been processed to have a large surface area, making it highly adsorbent. It is commonly used for its ability to adsorb (bind to) a wide range of substances, including toxins, chemicals, and impurities.

### Medical Use

Activated charcoal is used in medical settings to treat certain types of poisoning or overdose. It works by binding to the toxic substances in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and facilitating their elimination from the body. This can be useful in cases of poisoning by drugs, chemicals, or other toxic substances.

While activated charcoal can be effective for certain types of poisoning, it may not be suitable for all situations. In some cases, it can be contraindicated, and other treatments may be more appropriate. Activated charcoal should only be administered under the guidance of healthcare professionals to ensure its safe and appropriate use.

### Over-the-Counter Products

Activated charcoal is available over the counter in various forms, such as capsules and powder. Some people use it as a dietary supplement or for digestive issues, claiming that it can help alleviate gas, bloating, and indigestion.

When taken internally, it can also lead to potential side effects, including constipation, black stools, and gastrointestinal discomfort. It can also interfere with the absorption of medications and nutrients when taken internally. Therefore, it should not be used as a supplement without the guidance of a healthcare provider.

### Teeth Whitening

Activated charcoal is sometimes used in dental products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash, as a potential teeth-whitening agent. However, its efficacy for this purpose is a subject of debate, and its abrasive nature can potentially harm tooth enamel.

### Skin Care

Some skin care products, including face masks and cleansers, contain activated charcoal. It is believed to help remove impurities from the skin and unclog pores.

It's essential to be aware of the potential risks and consult with a dermatologist or healthcare provider if you have concerns or skin conditions.

### Water and Air Purification

Activated charcoal is used in water purification systems and air filters to remove impurities, chemicals, and odors. It is known for its high adsorption capacity.
