# Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) comments

"Changed my life. Improved sleep quality, decreased inflammation & overall symptoms significantly improved."

"I've been on LDN for about 4 months now. Inflammation has went down, my weight is not all over the place ( was hoping to lose some) my pain level is down. I'm on 4mg and going up to 6mg."

"I’ve reintroduced a few new foods without issue. I’ve eaten out a couple of times without issue when I thought for sure I’d end up sick. I very recently had surgery on my wrist and thought I’d have a flare after that, but I didn’t."

"Inflammation is tamped down by the LDN. My body is responding nicely. I have a lot of hope."

"It fixed my sleep issues. It gives me more reserves to pull on if I have a night of intermittent insomnia. It has also (I think) taken away my MCAS rage. I am SO calm."

"I take it. You can’t really drink on it and it makes stuff taste gross. I felt nausea for awhile, but it subsides."

"My daughter was prescribed LDN by her POTS doctor last year and it's been life-changing for her."

"My doctor started me on 1.5 and I think the dose was too high. I got headaches and started to experience brain fog and depersonalization.."

"Did nothing and horrible side effects for me. Toughed it out a year, never ever again."

"Unfortunately made me really sick every time I tried so not for me."

"One very low dose and I had a migraine, diarrhea and body aches for 4 days."
