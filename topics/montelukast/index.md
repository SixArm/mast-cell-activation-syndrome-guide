# Montelukast

Montelukast is a medication primarily used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It belongs to a class of drugs called leukotriene receptor antagonists. Brand name: Singulair.

Leukotrienes are chemicals in the body that play a role in inflammation, bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways), and other allergic reactions. Montelukast works by blocking the action of leukotrienes, thereby reducing inflammation and relaxing the muscles around the airways, which helps to improve breathing and reduce symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath associated with asthma.

In addition to asthma, montelukast is also used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, such as sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itching, and nasal congestion.

Montelukast is available in tablet, chewable tablet, and granule formulations for oral administration. It is usually taken once daily, either in the morning or evening, with or without food.

Common side effects of montelukast may include headache, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. In rare cases, montelukast has been associated with neuropsychiatric events such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression, and suicidal thoughts, particularly in children and adolescents. It's important to discuss any concerns or potential side effects with a healthcare provider before starting montelukast.
