# Vitamin E (tocopherol)

Vitamin E (also known as tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that serves as an antioxidant in the body, helping to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. It includes a group of compounds known as tocopherols and tocotrienols, with alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active form.

**Key points**:

* **Functions**: Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that can cause cellular damage. This helps the immune system, healthy skin, and healthy eyes.

* **Sources**: Dietary sources include nuts and seeds (e.g., almonds, sunflower seeds), vegetable oils (e.g., sunflower oil, safflower oil), green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach, broccoli), some fruits (e.g., kiwi), and fortified foods.

* **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**: The RDA for vitamin E varies by age, sex, and life stage. It is expressed in milligrams (mg) of alpha-tocopherol equivalents.

* **Supplementation**: It's generally preferable to obtain nutrients from a balanced diet, vitamin E supplements may be recommended in certain situations, such as in individuals with malabsorption disorders or specific medical conditions.

* **Deficiency**: Vitamin E deficiency is rare and is more likely to occur in individuals with malabsorption issues, genetic disorders, or conditions that impair fat absorption.

* **Toxicity**: Symptoms can include nausea, diarrhea, and an increased risk of bleeding.
