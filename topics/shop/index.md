Shopping for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), allergies, and histamine intolerance involves selecting products that are low in triggers that may exacerbate symptoms. Keeping a trigger diary may be helpful.

**Tips**:

**Fresh foods**: Choose very fresh foods whenever possible, or very fresh flash-frozen foods.

**Read labels**: Check labels for ingredients that may contain hidden problems, such as artificial preservatives, colorings, and flavorings.

**Allergy-friendly products**: Look for allergy-friendly, hypoallergenic, all-natural versions of products.

**Check for cross-contamination**: Be aware of potential cross-contamination with triggers when purchasing packaged foods.

**Consider organic options**: These may be less likely to contain pesticides, additives, and other potential triggers.

**Ask an expert**: Ask a healthcare provider or registered dietitian who specializes in managing MCAS, allergies, and histamine intolerance.
