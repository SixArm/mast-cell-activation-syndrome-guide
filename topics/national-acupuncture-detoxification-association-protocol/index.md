# National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) protocol

The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) protocol is a standardized ear acupuncture treatment developed to support individuals undergoing addiction recovery and behavioral health therapies. This protocol involves the insertion of fine, sterilized needles into five specific points on each ear: Shen Men, Sympathetic, Kidney, Liver, and Lung points. These points are believed to help balance the body's energy, alleviate withdrawal symptoms, reduce cravings, and promote overall physical and emotional well-being.

The NADA protocol is commonly used as an adjunct therapy in various settings, including addiction treatment centers, mental health facilities, and disaster relief programs. It is designed to be a non-verbal intervention that complements other therapeutic approaches, fostering a sense of calm, reducing anxiety and stress, and aiding in emotional regulation. Many practitioners and patients report that the protocol enhances the effectiveness of traditional treatments, making it easier for individuals to engage in and benefit from counseling and other recovery services.

One of the key benefits of the NADA protocol is its simplicity and accessibility. The treatment can be administered in group settings, making it cost-effective and easy to integrate into existing treatment programs. Sessions typically last between 30 to 45 minutes, and the treatment can be repeated as needed to provide ongoing support throughout the recovery process.
