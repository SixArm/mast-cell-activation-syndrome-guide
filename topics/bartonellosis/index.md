# Bartonellosis

Bartonellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Bartonella. The disease can manifest in various forms, and the symptoms can range from mild to severe. Bartonella species are transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected arthropods, such as fleas, ticks, lice, and sandflies.

**Key points:**

* **Bartonella henselae**: This species is commonly associated with cat scratch fever. It is transmitted through scratches or bites from infected cats and fleas. Symptoms include swollen and tender lymph nodes, fever, fatigue, and in some cases, an enlarged spleen.

* **Bartonella bacilliformis**: This species is associated with Carrion's disease, transmitted by sandflies. Carrion's disease has two phases. The Oroya fever phase is characterized by acute fever, anemia, and other systemic symptoms. The verruga peruana phase involves the development of skin lesions, including nodules and wart-like growths.

* **Chronic Bartonellosis**: Bartonellosis can become chronic, leading to persistent symptoms. Chronic Bartonella infections have been implicated in various conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome and neurologic manifestations.

* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is often challenging. Serological tests and molecular diagnostics, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may be used for diagnosis.

* **Treatment**:  Antibiotics are the primary treatment for Bartonellosis.
