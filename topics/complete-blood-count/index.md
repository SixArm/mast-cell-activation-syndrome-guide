# Complete blood count (CBC)

A complete blood count (CBC) is a common blood test. It is used by healthcare providers to assess overall health, screen for various medical conditions, and monitor the effectiveness of treatments. 

The CBC measures several key components of the blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, as well as additional parameters such as hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. RBCs are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues, while WBCs are part of the body's immune system and help fight infections and diseases. Platelets play a crucial role in blood clotting and wound healing.

The CBC provides information on the number, size, and shape of RBCs, as well as the concentration of hemoglobin within them. It also measures the total number of WBCs in the blood, along with the proportions of different types of WBCs (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) in what is called the "differential count". Additionally, the CBC measures the number of platelets in the blood.

Abnormalities in CBC parameters may indicate various conditions, ranging from minor infections to serious diseases. For example, low RBC counts or hemoglobin levels may suggest anemia, while elevated WBC counts may indicate infection or inflammation. Platelet abnormalities can signal bleeding disorders or clotting problems.
