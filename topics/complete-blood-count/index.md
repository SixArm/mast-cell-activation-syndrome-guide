# Complete blood count (CBC)

A complete blood count (CBC) is a common blood test that provides valuable information about the cellular components of the blood. It is an essential diagnostic tool used by healthcare providers to assess overall health, screen for various medical conditions, and monitor the effectiveness of treatments. 

The CBC measures several key components of the blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, as well as additional parameters such as hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. RBCs are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues, while WBCs are part of the body's immune system and help fight infections and diseases. Platelets play a crucial role in blood clotting and wound healing.

The CBC provides information on the number, size, and shape of RBCs, as well as the concentration of hemoglobin within them. It also measures the total number of WBCs in the blood, along with the proportions of different types of WBCs (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) in what is called the "differential count". Additionally, the CBC measures the number of platelets in the blood.

Interpretation of CBC results requires consideration of the patient's clinical history, symptoms, and other laboratory findings. Abnormalities in CBC parameters may indicate various conditions, ranging from minor infections to serious diseases. For example, low RBC counts or hemoglobin levels may suggest anemia, while elevated WBC counts may indicate infection or inflammation. Platelet abnormalities can signal bleeding disorders or clotting problems.

The CBC is used for a variety of purposes in clinical practice. It is often part of routine health screenings to assess overall health and detect underlying medical conditions, even in the absence of symptoms. Additionally, the CBC is used to diagnose various medical conditions, monitor disease progression, and evaluate the effects of treatments such as chemotherapy.

In summary, the complete blood count (CBC) is a fundamental blood test that provides important information about the cellular components of the blood. It plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of medical conditions and is an essential tool in clinical practice.
