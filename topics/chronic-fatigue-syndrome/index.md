# Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a complex and debilitating medical condition characterized by persistent and unexplained fatigue that is not alleviated by rest. CFS is a chronic condition.

**Key points**:

* **Fatigue and Exhaustion**: The hallmark symptom is severe fatigue that is not relieved by rest. This is often accompanied by a disabling decrease in energy.

* **Additional Symptoms**: Cognitive difficulties, unrefreshing sleep, muscle and joint pain, headaches, sore throat, and tender lymph nodes.

* **Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)**: CFS is often associated with post-exertional malaise, where physical or mental exertion can exacerbate symptoms and lead to a prolonged worsening of fatigue.

* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosing CFS can be challenging as there are no specific tests. Healthcare professionals typically rely on a thorough [medical history](../medical-history/\), [physical examination](../physical-examination/), and the exclusion of other possible causes of fatigue.

* **Unknown Cause**: CFS is complex condition with multiple potential contributing factors, including viral infections, immune system dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, and genetic predisposition.

* **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Management may include symptom management, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), and lifestyle adjustments.

* **Supportive Care**: May include managing sleep disturbances, addressing pain and other symptoms, and providing emotional support.
