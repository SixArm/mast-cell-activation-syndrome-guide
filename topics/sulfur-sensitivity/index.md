# Sulfur sensitivity

Sulfur sensitivity, also known as sulfur intolerance, is a condition in which an individual experiences adverse reactions to foods and substances containing sulfur or sulfites. Sulfur is a mineral that is naturally present in various foods and is an essential component of some amino acids and vitamins. However, some people may be sensitive or intolerant to sulfur-containing compounds, leading to a range of symptoms.

**Common symptoms**:

* **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea.

* **Skin symptoms**: hives, itchy skin, eczema.

* **Respiratory symptoms**: coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, nasal congestion.

* **Other symptoms**: headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, brain fog.

Sulfur intolerance is distinct from sulfite sensitivity or sulfite allergy, which is a specific reaction to sulfites commonly found in processed foods and beverages. Sulfite sensitivity can cause asthma-like symptoms and is characterized by a more immediate and severe allergic response.
