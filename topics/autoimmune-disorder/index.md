# Autoimmune disorder

In immunology, autoimmunity is the system of immune responses of an organism
against its own healthy cells, tissues and other normal body constituents.

Any disorder resulting from this type of immune response is termed an "autoimmune
disorder". 

Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1,
Henoch–Schönlein purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome,
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves'
disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and multiple
sclerosis.
