# Luteinizing hormone (LH)

Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a vital hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, playing a key role in regulating the reproductive system in both men and women. LH is crucial for reproductive health, influencing processes such as ovulation in women and testosterone production in men.

In women, LH is essential for the menstrual cycle and ovulation. It works in concert with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles. A significant surge in LH levels, known as the LH surge, triggers ovulation, which is the release of a mature egg from the ovary. This surge typically occurs around the middle of the menstrual cycle and is a critical indicator of fertility. After ovulation, LH supports the formation of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone necessary for maintaining a potential pregnancy.

In men, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, which is essential for the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics, sperm production, and overall reproductive health. Adequate LH levels are crucial for sustaining normal testosterone levels and ensuring proper function of the male reproductive system.

LH testing is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of fertility issues, menstrual irregularities, and disorders of the pituitary gland. Blood tests measuring LH levels can help diagnose conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), pituitary gland disorders, and hypothalamic dysfunction. Understanding and monitoring LH levels are integral to reproductive health and managing related medical conditions.
