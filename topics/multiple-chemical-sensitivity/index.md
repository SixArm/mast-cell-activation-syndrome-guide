* **Diagnosis**: Use medical history, symptom evaluation, and exclusion of other medical conditions with similar symptoms. Individuals with MCS may undergo allergy testing, environmental testing, or provocation testing to identify specific triggers.

* **Management**: Minimize exposure to triggers. Create a safe home environment by using non-toxic products and improving indoor air quality via good ventilation and air filtration. Use personal protective measures, such as masks and filters. Implement stress management techniques.

* **Challenges**: Living with MCS can be challenging, as individuals may face difficulties in finding suitable environments, accessing healthcare services, and navigating social situations where chemical exposures are common.
