# Trigger tracker

A trigger tracker is a record-keeping technique that helps a person discover their triggers, and how they relate to symptoms, treatments, and improvements. A trigger tracker is also known as a journal, log, record, or diary.

You can keep a trigger tracker by using a physical notebook or by using a spreadsheet, website, or mobile app. Some trigger tracker websites and apps make it easy to enter and analyze your information, and some provide information for specific triggers.

**Key points**:

* **Record details**: Write down every interaction with every item. Be as specific as possible.

* **Use the six W's**: Write down "Who, What, Where, When, Why, How". These six terms are good prompts for information gathering and problem solving.

* **Add Notes**: Include any relevant notes, such as how you felt (e.g. stressed, hungry, hot) and any reactions you have, during and after.

* **Review and Analyze**: Regularly review and analyze your entries. Look for patterns. Use this information to make informed decisions about your symptoms, treatments, and any areas for improvement.
