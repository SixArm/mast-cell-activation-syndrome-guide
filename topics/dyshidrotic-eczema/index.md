# Dyshidrotic eczema

Dyshidrotic eczema, also known as dyshidrosis or pompholyx, is a type of eczema characterized by small, intensely itchy blisters that typically develop on the hands and feet. These blisters are often filled with clear fluid and can cause discomfort and irritation. Dyshidrotic eczema can be acute or chronic and may occur in episodes or flare-ups.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: The primary symptom of dyshidrotic eczema is the development of small blisters, typically on the palms of the hands, sides of the fingers, and soles of the feet. These blisters may be accompanied by itching, redness, and inflammation of the affected skin. In severe cases, the blisters may become larger, burst, and crust over, leading to pain and discomfort.

* **Triggers**: Allergies or sensitivities to some metals (like nickel), detergents, or certain foods. Stress or emotional factors. Hot or humid weather with sweating. Contact with irritants.

* **Diagnosis**: Clinical examination and [medical history](../medical-history/\). In some cases, a healthcare provider may perform patch testing or other diagnostic tests to rule out other potential causes of blistering skin conditions.

* **Treatment**: Oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, moisturizers or emollients, trigger avoidance, and phototherapy (light therapy).

* **Prevention**: Lifestyle changes and strategies may help reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups. Practice good hand hygiene and avoiding excessive hand washing or exposure to irritants. Use mild fragrance-free soaps and skincare products. Manage stress. Wear protective gloves or footwear when working with irritants.
