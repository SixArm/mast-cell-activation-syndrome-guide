# Cholestasis

Cholestasis is a condition characterized by a reduction or cessation of bile flow from the liver into the intestine. Cholestasis can be a serious condition, especially if left untreated, as it can lead to liver damage and complications. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial.

**Key points**:


* **Types**: Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs due to factors affecting bile flow within the liver; common causes include liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, and genetic disorders. Extrahepatic cholestasis occurs due to obstruction of the bile ducts outside the liver; common causes include gallstones, tumors, strictures, and pancreatic disorders.

*-* **Symptoms**: Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), itching (pruritus), dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting.

* **Complications**: Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Nutritional deficiencies. Osteoporosis. Increased risk of gallstones. Liver damage and cirrhosis in chronic cases.

* **Diagnosis**: Blood tests for liver function (elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminases), serum bile acid levels. Imaging studies including ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) to visualize the bile ducts and liver. Liver biopsy.

* **Treatment**: Treatment may involve medications to manage liver diseases, surgical removal of gallstones or obstruction, or treatment of underlying conditions such as viral hepatitis. A low-fat diet may be recommended to reduce the workload on the liver.
