# Daith piercing

A daith piercing is a type of ear piercing that passes through the innermost fold of the cartilage of the ear, known as the "daith" (pronounced like "dayth"). It is named after this specific anatomical feature. Daith piercings have gained popularity in recent years for therapeutic benefits.

**Key points**:

* **Location**: A daith piercing is located in the innermost fold of the ear, where the cartilage is thickest. It is typically positioned near the entrance to the ear canal, above the tragus (the small, pointed flap of cartilage in front of the ear canal).

* **Procedure**: Like other types of ear piercings, a daith piercing is performed by a professional piercer using a sterilized needle. Healing typically takes several months.

* **Aesthetic Appeal**: Daith piercings are often chosen for their aesthetic appeal and unique placement. They can be adorned with a variety of jewelry styles, including curved barbells, captive bead rings, circular barbells, and seamless rings

* **Therapeutic Claims**: Daith piercings are associated with anecdotal claims of potential therapeutic benefits, particularly in the realm of migraine relief. Some individuals with migraines have reported a reduction in the frequency or severity of their headaches after getting a daith piercing.
