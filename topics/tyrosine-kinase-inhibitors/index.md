# Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a class of medications that interfere with the activity of tyrosine kinases, enzymes that play a crucial role in cell signaling and growth. Tyrosine kinases are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

TKIs work by binding to the ATP-binding site of tyrosine kinases, preventing the transfer of phosphate groups to tyrosine residues on target proteins. This interference disrupts the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth and survival.

TKIs are commonly used in the treatment of cancer, particularly certain types of leukemia, lung cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and renal cell carcinoma. By inhibiting the activity of specific tyrosine kinases that are overactive or mutated in cancer cells, TKIs can help slow down or stop the growth and spread of cancer.

TKIs are typically taken orally in the form of tablets or capsules. They are often used as targeted therapies, meaning they specifically target cancer cells while sparing normal cells, which can reduce the risk of certain side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy.

While TKIs have significantly improved outcomes for many cancer patients, they can cause side effects such as fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, and high blood pressure. It's essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of TKI therapy with a healthcare provider before starting treatment. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary to manage side effects and optimize treatment effectiveness.
