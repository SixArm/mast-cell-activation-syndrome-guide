# Primal Trust™

[Primal Trust website](https://www.primaltrust.org/regulate-level-1/) excerpts…

Designed for those struggling with chronic illness, chronic pain, trauma and more.

The focus is on improving nervous system capacity for stress and emotional processing to allow self-healing to occur.

In Regulate™ you will gain a complete understanding of:

* The Science of the Chronic Stress Response & Cell Danger Theory
* Polyvagal Theory and Somatic Awareness
* Vagus Nerve Toning
* Neuroplasticity- Brain Rewiring
* Somatic Movement and Presence practices
* Trauma Healing Principles, /Breath Work and more.
* Implementation of daily brain-body neuro retraining practices

The Level 1 Regulate™ Training is the prerequisite to the Level 2 Primal Trust™ Mentorship.

This is a 2-4 month online comprehensive program.

Modules are released WEEKLY.  We have a drip release for level 1 only, dripped weekly over 7 weeks to encourage pacing.  The reason is that Dr. Cat used to allow all access to level 1 and found that those with nervous system dysregulation would frantically rush through the material, applying all the tools at once, and completely overwhelm the nervous system.  The great news is that since the required pacing of the level 1 program has been in place, our outcomes for recovery have skyrocketed indicating that a slow and steady therapeutic approach wins the race!
