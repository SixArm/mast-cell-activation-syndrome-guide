# GreenGuard certification

GreenGuard is a certification program that focuses on indoor air quality and low chemical emissions in products and materials. It is administered by UL Environment, a division of Underwriters Laboratories, a global safety certification company.

The GreenGuard certification program sets standards for volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and chemical content in various products, including building materials, furnishings, electronics, cleaning products, and personal care items. Products that meet GreenGuard's stringent criteria are awarded certification, indicating that they have been tested and verified to have low emissions of harmful chemicals and pollutants.

**Key points**:

* **VOC Emissions Testing**: GreenGuard certification involves testing products for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are chemicals that can off-gas from products and contribute to indoor air pollution. Products must meet strict limits on VOC emissions to qualify for certification.

* **Chemical Content Analysis**: In addition to VOC emissions testing, GreenGuard evaluates products for the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, including formaldehyde, phthalates, heavy metals, and other hazardous substances. Products must comply with GreenGuard's standards for chemical content to receive certification.

* **Product Categories**: GreenGuard certification is available for a wide range of product categories, including building materials (such as paints, adhesives, and flooring), furniture and furnishings (such as mattresses and upholstery), electronic equipment, cleaning products, and personal care items (such as cosmetics and baby products).

* **Healthier Indoor Environments**: The goal of the GreenGuard certification program is to promote healthier indoor environments by reducing exposure to harmful chemicals and pollutants. Products that bear the GreenGuard certification label can help consumers make informed choices and create healthier indoor spaces for living, working, and learning.

* **Third-Party Verification**: GreenGuard certification involves independent, third-party testing and verification to ensure that products meet the program's rigorous standards. This provides consumers with confidence that certified products have been evaluated by an impartial and trusted organization.

GreenGuard certification is recognized by architects, designers, building professionals, and consumers as a mark of quality and safety in indoor environments. By choosing GreenGuard-certified products, individuals and organizations can help minimize indoor air pollution and create healthier, more sustainable indoor spaces.
