# GreenGuard certification

The GreenGuard certification program sets standards for volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and chemical content in various products, including building materials, furnishings, electronics, cleaning products, and personal care items. Products that meet GreenGuard's stringent criteria are awarded certification, indicating that they have been tested and verified to have low emissions of harmful chemicals and pollutants.

**Key points**:

* **Test VOCs**: GreenGuard tests products for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are chemicals that can off-gas from products and contribute to indoor air pollution.

* **Analyze Chemicals**: GreenGuard evaluates products for the presence of potentially harmful chemicals, including formaldehyde, phthalates, heavy metals, and other hazardous substances.

* **Product Categories**: GreenGuard is available for a wide range of product categories, including building materials, furnishings, electronic equipment, cleaning products, and personal care items (such as cosmetics and baby products).

* **Healthier Indoor Environments**: The goal of the GreenGuard certification program is to promote healthier indoor environments by reducing exposure to harmful chemicals and pollutants.

* **Third-Party Verification**: GreenGuard certification involves independent, third-party testing and verification to ensure that products meet the program's rigorous standards.
