# Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment used to alleviate symptoms associated with hormonal imbalances, particularly during menopause and andropause. It involves supplementing the body with hormones, such as [estrogen](../estrogen/), [progesterone](../progesterone/), and [testosterone](../testosterone/), to restore hormonal levels and improve quality of life.

HRT is commonly prescribed to women experiencing menopause, a natural decline in reproductive hormones that leads to symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and vaginal dryness. Estrogen therapy, often combined with progesterone for women with intact uteruses, helps mitigate these symptoms and can also prevent osteoporosis by maintaining bone density.

For men undergoing andropause, characterized by a gradual decrease in testosterone levels, HRT can address symptoms such as fatigue, decreased libido, and muscle loss. Testosterone replacement therapy can help restore energy levels, improve mood, and enhance physical strength.

Despite its benefits, HRT is not without risks. Studies have linked long-term HRT, especially estrogen-progestin therapy, to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. These risks vary depending on the type of hormones used, the dosage, and the duration of therapy. Consequently, healthcare providers carefully evaluate the potential benefits and risks before recommending HRT.
