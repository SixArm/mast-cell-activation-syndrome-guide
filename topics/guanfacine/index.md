# Guanfacine

Brand names: Tenex (immediate-release), Intuniv (extended-release).

Guanfacine is a medication primarily used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and hypertension. As an alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist, it works by stimulating receptors in the brain that reduce sympathetic nerve impulses, resulting in decreased blood pressure and improved focus and impulse control. Guanfacine is particularly valuable in managing ADHD symptoms such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and it can be used alone or in combination with other ADHD medications.

In the treatment of ADHD, guanfacine is available in an extended-release form, which allows for once-daily dosing and provides a steady therapeutic effect throughout the day. This makes it a convenient option for children and adolescents who may have difficulty adhering to multiple doses. Clinical studies have shown that guanfacine can effectively improve attention and reduce hyperactive behavior, contributing to better academic and social functioning.

Guanfacine's use in hypertension involves its ability to lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and decreasing heart rate. This is achieved through its central action on alpha-2A receptors, leading to reduced sympathetic outflow from the brain. It is typically prescribed when other antihypertensive medications are insufficient or contraindicated.

While guanfacine is generally well-tolerated, it can cause side effects such as drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, and dizziness. These effects are usually mild but should be monitored, especially in the initial stages of treatment. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential to ensure the medication's efficacy and adjust the dosage if necessary. Overall, guanfacine offers significant benefits in managing ADHD and hypertension, improving quality of life for affected individuals.
