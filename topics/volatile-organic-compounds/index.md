# Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are a group of organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, meaning they can easily evaporate into the air. See also [activated carbon filters](../activated-carbon-filters/).

**Key points:**

* **Sources:** VOCs can be released from a wide range of sources, including household products, building materials, furnishings, paints, solvents, varnishes, cleaning supplies, personal care products, vehicle exhaust, and industrial processes.

* **Common VOCs:** Examples of common VOCs include benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, ethylene glycol, and acetone, among others. Each VOC has its own set of potential health effects.

* **Health Effects:** Some VOCs can have short-term and long-term health effects. Short-term exposure may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, and dizziness. Long-term exposure to certain VOCs has been associated with respiratory, neurological, and other health problems.

* **Indoor Air Quality:** VOCs are a significant contributor to indoor air pollution. Adequate ventilation is crucial. Air filters and activated carbon filters can help.

* **Air Quality Testing:** Air quality testing may be conducted to measure VOC levels in indoor environments. This can help identify specific sources and guide mitigation strategies.

* **Environmental Impact:** Some VOCs can contribute to outdoor air pollution and the formation of ground-level ozone. Certain VOCs also play a role in the complex chemistry of smog formation.
