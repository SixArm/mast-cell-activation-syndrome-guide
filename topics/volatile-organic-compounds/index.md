# Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are a group of organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, meaning they can easily evaporate into the air. These compounds can be emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids, and they are found in a variety of products and materials.

**Key points:**

* **Sources:** VOCs can be released from a wide range of sources, including household products, building materials, furnishings, paints, solvents, cleaning supplies, personal care products, vehicle exhaust, and industrial processes.

* **Common VOCs:** Examples of common VOCs include benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, ethylene glycol, and acetone, among others. Each VOC has its own set of potential health effects.

* **Indoor Air Quality:** VOCs are a significant contributor to indoor air pollution. Concentrations of VOCs can be higher indoors than outdoors, especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.

* **Health Effects:** Some VOCs can have short-term and long-term health effects. Short-term exposure may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, and dizziness. Long-term exposure to certain VOCs has been associated with respiratory, neurological, and other health problems.

* **Paints and Coatings:** Paints and coatings are major sources of VOC emissions. Many conventional paints contain solvents that release VOCs into the air during and after application.

* **Ventilation:** Adequate ventilation is crucial for reducing indoor concentrations of VOCs. Good ventilation helps dilute and remove VOCs from indoor air. Opening windows, using exhaust fans, and maintaining a flow of fresh air are effective ventilation strategies.

* **Air Quality Testing:** In some cases, air quality testing may be conducted to measure VOC levels in indoor environments. This can help identify specific sources and guide mitigation strategies.

* **Environmental Impact:** Some VOCs can contribute to outdoor air pollution and the formation of ground-level ozone. Certain VOCs also play a role in the complex chemistry of smog formation.
