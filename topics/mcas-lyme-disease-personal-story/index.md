# MCAS + Lyme disease (personal story)

TODO

My story is/was quite similar to yours. Not having the KIT gene is a good thing
that means you most likely don’t have masto. Just bad MCAS. I went into
anaphylaxis over 132 times in one year. Similar situation as you: weather,
emotional changes, foods, smells, and sometimes idiopathically I would just go
into anaphylaxis. I’m also diagnosed with EDS. I did go through masto testing-
all was normal thankfully! I went through a bunch of allergy meds
(antihistamines, steroids) but nothing was working. 

Here’s my current protocol that I have found helpful:

- Monthly Xolair injections

- Daily Chromolyn Sodium

- Antihistamines and inhalers and EpiPen as needed.

- Monthly IVIG infusions. I got it billed under a different diagnosis I have but
“technically” it can also be useful for MCAS patients. Document your triggers
and try to avoid them.

We also found out I had Lyme and coinfections that went untreated for over a
decade. I got diagnosed through Igenex Labs by Lyme Literate Medical
Doctor/Integrative Doctor. Years prior I had a false negative on western blot
through my PCP; we later found out the Western Blot is NOT an accurate test for
Lyme Disease you must go through Igenex and find an LLMD to properly treat.

I’ve been on treatment for that for nearly a year now (supplements, anti virals,
antibiotics) and have noticed VAST symptom improvement with not just MCAS, but
also with other health issues.

Don’t give up! MCAS can get more manageable! I no longer go into anaphylaxis, I
can eat more foods than I used to, and I don’t have as bad of hives or smell
sensitivity etc. I’m wishing you the BEST!🙏🩷 I would recommend asking your doc
about those treatments I listed above, and get tested for Lyme! If you have both
EDS and untreated Lyme going on, I can confirm it is a living nightmire😭😂
