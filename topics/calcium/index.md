# Calcium

Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological functions in the body, including bone health, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.

**Key points:**

* **Importance:** Calcium is vital for the development and maintenance of strong bones and teeth, and for normal blood clotting, muscle function, and nerve signaling.

* **Dietary Sources:** Calcium-rich foods include dairy products, leafy green vegetables, fortified foods, and certain seafood such as sardines and salmon with bones.

* **Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for adults:** 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams per day.

* **Supplement Forms:** Calcium supplements are available in various forms, including calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium gluconate, and calcium lactate. The choice of form may depend on factors like absorption and tolerance. For example, calcium citrate is often recommended for individuals with reduced stomach acid or those taking acid-reducing medications.

* **Potential Side Effects:** Excessive calcium intake, either from dietary sources or supplements, can lead to hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by symptoms like kidney stones, constipation, and impaired absorption of other minerals. It is important not to exceed recommended intake levels.
