# Adrenaline dump versus histamine dump

An adrenaline dump feels like one or more of these:

* you feel speedy, like energetic, fight or flight

* mental sharpness, clarity, accuracy

* easy to breathe, because of airways opening up

* higher blood pressure, because of vasoconstriction

* treatment tips: put a ice pack on the back of your neck; splash cold water on your face; put your feet up above your heart; blow out of your mouth like you are blowing bubbles.

* typical duration after treatment: a few minutes to start feeling some relief.

A histamine dump feels like one or more of these:

* you feel sluggish, and may even feel impending doom

* mental dullness, confusion, fogginess

* hard to breathe, because of throat closing or asthma-like feeling

* lower blood pressure, because of vasodilation

* treatment tips: take a first-generation antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl) which may cause drowsiness or confusion; try herbal tea such as stinging nettle; if symptoms are severe then use an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) such as an EPIPEN.

* typical duration after treatment: 10-30 minutes to start feeling some relief.
