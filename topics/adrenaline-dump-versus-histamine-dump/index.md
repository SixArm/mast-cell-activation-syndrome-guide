# Adrenaline dump versus histamine dump

An adrenaline dump feels like one or more of these:

* fight or flight
   
* mental sharpness and clarity

* easy to breath, because of getting lots of oxygen

A histamine dump feels like one or more of these:

* impending doom
 
* mental dullness and confusion, 
  
* hard to breathe, because of throat closing or asthma-like feeling
