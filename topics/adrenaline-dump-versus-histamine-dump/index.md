# Adrenaline dump versus histamine dump

An adrenaline dump feels like one or more of these:

* you feel speedy, like energetic, fight or flight
   
* mental sharpness, clarity, accuracy

* easy to breath, because of getting lots of oxygen

* higher blood pressure, due to vasoconstriction

* treatment tips: put a ice pack on the back of your neck; splash cold water on your face; put your feet up above your heart; blow out of your mouth like you are blowing bubbles.

* typical duration: a few minutes to start feeling some relief.
  
A histamine dump feels like one or more of these:

* you feel sluggish, and may even feel impending doom
 
* mental dullness, confusion, fogginess
  
* hard to breathe, because of throat closing or asthma-like feeling

* lower blood pressure, due to vasodilation

* treatment tips: take a first-generation antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl) which may cause drowsiness or confusion; try herbal tea such as stinging nettle; if symptoms are severe then use an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) such as an EPIPEN.

* typical duration: 10-30 minutes to start feeling some relief.
