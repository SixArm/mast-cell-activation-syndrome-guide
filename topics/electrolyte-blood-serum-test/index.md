# Electrolyte blood serum test

An electrolyte blood serum test, also known as an electrolyte panel, is a group of medical tests that measure the levels of electrolytes in the blood serum. Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electric charge and play a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body, including fluid balance, nerve function, muscle contraction, and acid-base balance.

**Common tests**:

* **Sodium (NA)**: Controls fluid levels and aids nerve and muscle function.

* **Potassium (K)**: Supports heart, nerve and muscle function, as well as metabolism.

* **Calcium (Ca)**: Supports your musculoskeletal system (bones and muscles), nervous system and circulatory system.
    
* **Chloride (Cl)**: Helps maintain healthy blood pressure and body fluid levels.

* **Magnesium (Mg)**: Aids nerve and muscle function and promotes the growth of bones and teeth (skeletal system).

* **Phosphate (PO4)**: Develops healthy teeth and bones and aids nerve and muscle function.

* **Bicarbonate (HC03)**: Maintains a healthy balance of acids and basic alkaline compounds in blood (acid-base balance). It also moves carbon dioxide through your bloodstream.

An electrolyte blood serum test may be ordered as part of a routine health checkup to assess overall health and detect imbalances in electrolyte levels. It may also be ordered to evaluate and monitor conditions that can affect electrolyte balance, such as dehydration, kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain medications.
