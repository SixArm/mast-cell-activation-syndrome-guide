# Omega-3

Omega-3 fatty acids are a class of essential polyunsaturated fats that are important for various aspects of human health. These fats are considered essential because the human body cannot synthesize them on its own and must obtain them from dietary sources.

The primary types of health-related omega-3 fatty acids are Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA), Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). High ALA foods are flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and hemp seeds. High EPA and DHA foods are fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines.
