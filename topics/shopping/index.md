# Shopping

Shopping for mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), allergies, and histamine intolerance involves selecting foods and products that are low in histamine and other triggers that may exacerbate symptoms. 

Remember that individual triggers and tolerances can vary widely among individuals with MCAS, allergies, and histamine intolerance, so it's essential to listen to your body and pay attention to how different foods and products affect you personally. Keeping a food and symptom diary may also be helpful in identifying triggers and patterns over time.

**Tips**:

**Fresh foods**: Choose fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, and seafood whenever possible. Fresh foods are generally lower in histamine compared to processed or aged foods.

**Low-histamine foods**: Include foods that are naturally low in histamine, such as fresh meats (e.g., chicken, turkey, fish), fresh fruits (except for citrus fruits and berries), fresh vegetables (except for tomatoes, spinach, and eggplant), rice, gluten-free grains (e.g., quinoa, millet), and some dairy alternatives (e.g., almond milk, coconut milk).

**Avoid high-histamine foods**: Minimize or avoid foods that are high in histamine or that trigger histamine release, such as aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi), vinegar, alcohol (especially wine and beer), canned foods, and leftovers.

**Read labels**: Check food labels for ingredients that may contain hidden sources of histamine or trigger symptoms, such as artificial preservatives, colorings, and flavorings.

**Consider fresh herbs and spices**: While some herbs and spices may contain histamine or trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals, many people with histamine intolerance find that fresh herbs and spices are well-tolerated.

**Allergy-friendly products**: Look for allergy-friendly or hypoallergenic versions of personal care products, household cleaners, and cosmetics that are free from common allergens and irritating ingredients.

**Natural cleaning products**: Choose natural cleaning products that are free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, which can trigger allergic reactions and worsen symptoms in individuals with MCAS or histamine intolerance.

**Check for cross-contamination**: Be aware of potential cross-contamination with allergens when purchasing packaged foods, especially if you have food allergies in addition to MCAS or histamine intolerance. Look for allergen labeling and choose products from reputable manufacturers.

**Consider organic options**: Some individuals with MCAS or histamine intolerance find that organic foods are better tolerated, as they may be less likely to contain pesticides, additives, and other potential triggers.

**Consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian**: If you're unsure about which foods and products are safe for you to consume or use, consider consulting with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian who specializes in managing MCAS, allergies, and histamine intolerance. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific needs and sensitivities.
