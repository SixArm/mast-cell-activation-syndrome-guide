# Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids, often referred to simply as steroids, are a class of synthetic drugs that mimic the natural corticosteroid hormones produced by the adrenal glands. These medications are commonly prescribed for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Examples: prednisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone.

Corticosteroids can have side effects such as weight gain, increased blood pressure, bone thinning (osteoporosis), increased susceptibility to infections, and mood changes.

**Two main types:**

* **Glucocorticoids**: These have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.

* **Mineralocorticoids**: These regulate electrolyte and fluid balance in the body.

**Treatable conditions:**

* **Inflammatory Disorders:** Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and inflammatory bowel disease.

* **Allergic Reactions:** Acute allergic reactions and chronic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis.

* **Autoimmune Diseases:** Diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, such as multiple sclerosis.

* **Respiratory Conditions:** Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

* **Skin Conditions:** Topical [corticosteroids](../corticosteroids/) are applied to the skin to treat conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis.
