# Bilastine

Bilastine is a second-generation antihistamine medication used primarily for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives of unknown cause).  It provides rapid and long-lasting symptom relief with once-daily dosing, making it a convenient option for patients with allergic conditions.

**Key points**:

* **Mechanism of Action**: Bilastine belongs to the class of antihistamine drugs known as H1 receptor antagonists. It works by selectively blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, thereby preventing or reducing allergic symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, and hives.

* **Indications**: Bilastine is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial) and chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children aged 6 years and older. It is used to alleviate symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, runny nose, and skin rash or hives.

* **Dosage and Administration**: The usual dosage of bilastine for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older is 20 mg taken orally once daily, preferably at the same time each day. For children aged 6 to 11 years, the recommended dosage is 10 mg once daily. Bilastine is typically taken with water, with or without food.

* **Onset and Duration of Action**: Bilastine has a rapid onset of action, with symptom relief typically occurring within 1 hour after administration. It provides 24-hour symptom control with once-daily dosing, making it convenient for patients.

* **Safety and Side Effects**: Bilastine is generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines. Common side effects may include headache, dizziness, somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue, and dry mouth. Bilastine is considered non-sedating at therapeutic doses and does not have significant effects on cognitive function or psychomotor performance.

* **Contraindications**: Bilastine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients in the formulation. It should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (liver dysfunction) or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

* **Special Populations**: Bilastine is generally safe for use in elderly patients and those with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. However, caution is advised in these populations, and dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors.

* **Drug Interactions**: Bilastine has a low potential for drug interactions due to its minimal affinity for cytochrome P450 enzymes and low risk of cardiac arrhythmias. However, caution should be exercised when co-administering bilastine with other drugs that may prolong the QT interval or inhibit its metabolism.
