**Key points**:

* **Action**: Bilastine belongs to the class of antihistamine drugs known as H1 receptor antagonists. It blocks the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, thereby preventing or reducing allergic symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, and hives.

* **Indications**: For relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial) and chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children aged 6 years and older.

* **Administration**: The usual dosage of bilastine for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older is 20 mg taken orally once daily, preferably at the same time each day. For children aged 6 to 11 years, the recommended dosage is 10 mg once daily. Bilastine is typically taken with water, with or without food.

* **Timing**: Bilastine has a rapid onset of action, with symptom relief typically occurring within 1 hour after administration. It provides 24-hour symptom control.

* **Safety**: Side effects may include headache, dizziness, somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue, and dry mouth. Bilastine is considered non-sedating at therapeutic doses.

* **Contraindications**: It should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (liver dysfunction) or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.
