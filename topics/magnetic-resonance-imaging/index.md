# Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that uses powerful magnetic fields, radio waves, and a computer to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. Unlike X-rays or CT scans, MRI does not use ionizing radiation, making it a safer option for imaging, especially for repeated use. MRI is particularly useful for visualizing soft tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord, muscles, and joints, providing high-resolution images that are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

During an MRI procedure, the patient lies on a table that slides into a cylindrical scanner. The machine creates a strong magnetic field around the body, aligning the protons in the body's hydrogen atoms. When radio waves are applied, these protons produce signals that are detected by the scanner. A computer processes these signals to create cross-sectional images of the body. Depending on the area being examined, the procedure can take from 30 minutes to an hour or more, during which the patient must remain still to ensure clear images.

MRI is widely used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including brain and spinal cord abnormalities, joint and musculoskeletal disorders, heart and vascular diseases, and cancers. The detailed images help in identifying the exact location and extent of abnormalities, facilitating early detection and better treatment outcomes. In some cases, a contrast agent, usually gadolinium, is injected into the bloodstream to enhance image clarity and highlight specific areas of interest.
