# Dairy sensitivity

Dairy sensitivity, also known as lactose intolerance or dairy intolerance, occurs when an individual has difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar found in milk and other dairy products. This condition arises from a deficiency in lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose in the digestive system. When lactose is not properly digested, it can lead to a range of uncomfortable symptoms.

Common symptoms of dairy sensitivity include bloating, gas, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. These symptoms typically occur within a few hours of consuming dairy products and can vary in severity depending on the amount of lactose ingested and the individual's level of lactase deficiency. Some people with dairy sensitivity may tolerate small amounts of dairy, while others may react to even trace amounts.

Diagnosing dairy sensitivity often involves a combination of patient history, symptom assessment, and diagnostic tests. The hydrogen breath test is a common method used to diagnose lactose intolerance. During this test, the patient consumes a lactose-containing drink, and their breath is analyzed for hydrogen levels, which increase when lactose is not properly digested. Another approach is the lactose tolerance test, which measures blood glucose levels after consuming lactose to see if they rise, indicating proper digestion.

Managing dairy sensitivity primarily involves dietary modifications to reduce or eliminate lactose intake. Lactose-free dairy products and alternatives, such as almond milk, soy milk, and coconut milk, can be used as substitutes. Additionally, lactase enzyme supplements are available and can help individuals digest lactose more effectively when taken before consuming dairy. It is also important to read food labels carefully, as lactose can be found in unexpected products like bread, cereals, and processed foods.

Working with a healthcare provider or a dietitian can help individuals with dairy sensitivity develop a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs without causing symptoms. By making appropriate dietary adjustments, those with dairy sensitivity can manage their condition effectively and maintain a comfortable, healthy lifestyle.
