# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome - laboratory tests

The diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) can be challenging and often requires a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, and laboratory tests. It's important to note that there is no single definitive test for MCAS, and the interpretation of results should be done by a healthcare professional experienced in the field. Here are some laboratory tests that may be considered in the evaluation of MCAS:

* **Serum Tryptase**: Tryptase is an enzyme released by mast cells during activation. Elevated serum tryptase levels may suggest mast cell activation. However, normal levels do not rule out MCAS, as not all MCAS cases show elevated tryptase.

* **Urinary N-Methylhistamine (uNMH) or Histamine Metabolites**: Histamine is broken down in the body, and measuring its metabolites, such as N-methylhistamine, in urine can provide an indirect indication of mast cell activity.

* **Plasma Histamine**: Direct measurement of histamine levels in plasma can be performed. Elevated plasma histamine, especially during symptom flare-ups, may support a diagnosis of MCAS.

* **Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)**: Prostaglandin D2 is another mediator released by mast cells. Elevated levels in urine or blood may suggest mast cell activation.

* **Plasma Tryptase**: In addition to serum tryptase, measuring plasma tryptase levels may be considered. Plasma tryptase can be more stable and provide additional information.

* **Plasma Chromogranin A**: Chromogranin A is a protein released by neuroendocrine cells, including mast cells. Elevated levels may be associated with mast cell activation.

* **Cytokine Panel**: Measurement of cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), can provide insights into the inflammatory response associated with MCAS.

* **Comprehensive Allergy Testing**: Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may help identify specific allergens triggering mast cell activation.

* **Genetic Testing**: Some individuals with MCAS may have genetic predispositions that affect their ability to regulate mast cell activity. Genetic testing for mutations associated with mast cell disorders may be considered.
