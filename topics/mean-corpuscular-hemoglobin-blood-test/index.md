# Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) blood test

The mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) blood test measures the average amount of hemoglobin present in a single red blood cell. Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. MCH is typically part of a complete blood count (CBC) and is calculated by dividing the total hemoglobin concentration by the number of red blood cells.

MCH values are used to help diagnose and classify types of anemia. Normal MCH values typically range from 27 to 33 picograms per cell. Low MCH values, or hypochromia, indicate that red blood cells have less hemoglobin than normal, which can be seen in conditions such as iron-deficiency anemia and thalassemia. Symptoms of low   MCH may include fatigue, weakness, and pallor. Conversely, high MCH values, or hyperchromia, suggest that red blood cells contain more hemoglobin than normal, which can occur in macrocytic anemias such as those caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies.

The MCH test involves drawing a blood sample, usually from a vein in the arm, with results typically available within a few hours to a day. Interpretation of MCH results should consider other RBC indices, such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying hematologic condition.

Accurate measurement of MCH is crucial for diagnosing and managing various types of anemia and other blood disorders. It helps healthcare providers determine the cause of anemia and guide appropriate treatment, ensuring that patients receive effective and targeted care for their condition.
