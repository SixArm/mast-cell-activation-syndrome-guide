# Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a crucial hormone in the regulation of the reproductive system, produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It plays a vital role in both male and female reproductive health by stimulating the growth and maturation of reproductive cells.

In women, FSH is essential for the development of ovarian follicles, which are the structures that contain and release eggs during the menstrual cycle. FSH levels fluctuate throughout the cycle, with a significant surge occurring just before ovulation to trigger the release of a mature egg. Proper FSH function is critical for normal menstrual cycles and fertility. Abnormal FSH levels can indicate various reproductive issues, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or primary ovarian insufficiency.

In men, FSH is necessary for the production and maturation of sperm. It acts on the Sertoli cells in the testes, which support and nourish developing sperm cells. Adequate levels of FSH are essential for maintaining healthy sperm production and overall male fertility. Low FSH levels in men can lead to a decreased sperm count and infertility.

FSH testing is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of fertility issues, hormonal imbalances, and certain endocrine disorders. Blood tests measuring FSH levels can help evaluate the function of the reproductive organs and the pituitary gland, providing critical information for diagnosing conditions like infertility, menopause, and pituitary disorders. Understanding and regulating FSH levels are key components of reproductive health care.
