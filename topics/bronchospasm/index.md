# Bronchospasm

Bronchospasm refers to the sudden constriction or narrowing of the airways in the lungs, particularly the bronchi and bronchioles. This constriction is caused by the tightening of the smooth muscles that surround the airways. It can lead to difficulty breathing and is a characteristic feature of various respiratory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

**Common causes**:

* **Asthma**: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of bronchospasm, resulting in symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing.

* **Allergic Reactions**: Allergic triggers, such as pollen, dust mites, animal dander, or certain foods, can lead to bronchospasm in individuals with allergic asthma.

* **Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (EIB)**: Some people experience bronchospasm during or after physical activity, especially in cold or dry conditions.

* **Respiratory Infections**: Infections like viral bronchitis or the common cold can lead to bronchospasm, particularly in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions.

* **Irritants**: Exposure to irritants like smoke, strong odors, or chemical fumes can trigger bronchospasm in susceptible individuals.

**Symptoms**:

* **Wheezing**: A high-pitched whistling sound during breathing.
* **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing or catching your breath.
* **Coughing**: Often accompanied by the production of thick mucus.
* **Chest tightness**: A feeling of pressure or constriction in the chest.
