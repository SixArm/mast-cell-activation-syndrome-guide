# Systemic mastocytosis (SM)

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) affects the skin and also other organs and tissues in the body.

**Subtypes:**

* **Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis:** This is the most common subtype of systemic mastocytosis and is usually not associated with aggressive symptoms or organ damage.

* **Systemic Mastocytosis with an Associated Hematologic Neoplasm (SM-AHN):** This subtype is characterized by the presence of a second blood disorder, such as myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasms.

* **Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis (ASM):** This subtype is more severe and may involve organ damage or failure.

* **Mast Cell Leukemia (MCL):** This is the rarest and most aggressive form of systemic mastocytosis, where mast cells accumulate in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.
