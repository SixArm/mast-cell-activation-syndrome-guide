# Imatinib instructions

If you're considering taking prescription imatinib (brand name Gleevec), then ask your doctor about these instructions.

All doses of imatinib  should be taken with a meal, ideally just after the meal, and a large glass of water. This helps prevent stomach irritation.

Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, whereas a dose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day. Imatinib can be dissolved in water or apple juice for patients having difficulty swallowing.

Be careful not to handle crushed or broken tablets.

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may cause the blood levels of this medicine to be higher than normal.

Do not take dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone or St. John's wort, or anti-epileptic drugs (such as carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin).

If you're scared to take it, then you can consider visiting a pharmacy, or urgent care facility, or hospital, or police/fire/amublance station, and tell the attending person that you're about to take it and ask if someone can keep an eye on you.
