# Nasal corticosteroids

Nasal corticosteroids, also known as intranasal steroids (INS), are medications designed to relieve inflammation in the nasal passages, commonly used to treat conditions such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. These steroids work by reducing the inflammation and swelling in the nasal tissues, thereby alleviating symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Examples include fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone, and triamcinolone.

One of the main advantages of nasal corticosteroids is their ability to target the nasal passages directly, providing localized treatment with minimal systemic absorption. This means they can effectively reduce inflammation and provide symptom relief with a lower risk of systemic side effects compared to oral corticosteroids. Regular use of nasal corticosteroids can also help prevent the recurrence of symptoms and improve the overall quality of life for individuals with chronic nasal inflammation.

While generally safe and well-tolerated, nasal corticosteroids can cause side effects in some users. Common side effects include nasal irritation, dryness, nosebleeds, and, less frequently, headaches. It is important to use these medications as directed by a healthcare provider, ensuring proper technique to maximize benefits and minimize side effects. For example, pointing the spray away from the nasal septum can reduce the risk of irritation and nosebleeds.
