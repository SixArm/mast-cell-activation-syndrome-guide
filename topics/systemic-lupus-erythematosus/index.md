# Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues and organs. This widespread inflammation can affect various body systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. The exact cause of SLE is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.

SLE is characterized by periods of illness, known as flares, and periods of remission. Common symptoms include fatigue, joint pain and swelling, skin rashes (notably the "butterfly rash" across the cheeks and nose), and fever. More severe cases can lead to complications such as kidney damage (lupus nephritis), cardiovascular disease, and neurological issues. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs and laboratory tests, including antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests, which are positive in most SLE patients.

Treatment of SLE aims to control symptoms and prevent flare-ups. This typically involves medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine, and immunosuppressants. Regular monitoring and a tailored treatment plan are essential, as the disease's progression and severity can vary widely among individuals.

Living with SLE requires ongoing medical care and lifestyle adjustments. Patients are advised to avoid triggers that may induce flares, such as excessive sunlight exposure and stress. With appropriate management, many individuals with SLE can lead active and productive lives, although the disease often necessitates long-term treatment and vigilance.
