# Health Effects Roster of Type-Specific Formers of Mycotoxins and Inflammagens - 2nd Version (HERTSMI-2)

"Health Effects Roster of Type-Specific Formers of Mycotoxins and Inflammagens - 2nd Version" (HERTSMI-2) is a scoring system for the presence and types of mold species in indoor environments, focusing on mycotoxin health risks.

**Key points:**

* **Scoring System**: HERTSMI-2 assigns a score to different mold species based on their potential health impact. The score is derived from the mold's ability to produce mycotoxins (toxic compounds produced by some molds) and its association with inflammatory responses.

* **Specific Molds**: The scoring system focuses on specific molds that are commonly found indoors and are considered to be potentially harmful. Examples include Stachybotrys chartarum, Aspergillus species, Penicillium species, and others.

* **Health Implications**: Higher HERTSMI-2 scores are associated with a higher risk of adverse health effects, such as respiratory symptoms and allergic reactions.

* **Assessment of Indoor Environments**: HERTSMI-2 is often used in the assessment of indoor environments, particularly in the context of mold inspections and remediation efforts.

* **Limitations**: The relationship between mold exposure and health effects is complex and can vary among individuals. The extent of risk depends on factors such as individual susceptibility, duration of exposure, and overall health.
