# Phosphatidylcholine

Phosphatidylcholine is a type of phospholipid, a class of lipids that are essential components of cell membranes. Phosphatidylcholine also is a precursor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is involved in memory, learning, and muscle contraction.

Phosphatidylcholine is found in various foods, particularly in high-fat foods such as eggs, soybeans, sunflower seeds, and peanuts. It is available as a dietary supplement in the form of lecithin.

**Benefits**:

* **Liver health**: Supports liver health and function, particularly in the management of liver conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver damage caused by alcohol consumption or toxins.

* **Cognitive function**: As a precursor to acetylcholine, phosphatidylcholine may help support cognitive function and memory.

* **Cholesterol metabolism**: May help support healthy cholesterol levels by promoting the transport of cholesterol and other fats in the bloodstream.

* **Digestive health**: Lecithin, which contains phosphatidylcholine, may help support digestive health by promoting the emulsification of fats and aiding in their digestion and absorption.

* **Skin health**: May help improve skin hydration, elasticity, and barrier function.
