# Laundry

Doing laundry can reduce allergens, irritants, and triggers. Generally try to do laundry each week.

**Tips**:

* **Use hypoallergenic detergents.** Look for detergents that do not contain fragrances, dyes, or chemicals. Some key phrases are "Hypoallergenic" and "Free and Clear".

* **Use an extra rinse cycle.** This because basic washes do not always get all the detergent out. This issue especially effects low-water washing machines, high-efficiency washing machines, and

* **Wash bedding separately.** This is especially important when your bedding is all natural fibers, and your other laundry has synthetic materials that might degrade into microplastics.

* **Beware dust mites and Der p 1.** Exposure to the house dust mite (HDM) allergen Der p 1 has increasingly been associated with the development and exacerbation of asthma.

* **Use the hottest water setting.** If your washing machine offers an extra-hot extra-thorough anti-allergen cycle, then use it. Researchers found that washing laundry in water that is at least 60ºC (140ºF) kills all house dust mites. This is compared with water that is 40ºC (104ºF) which kills just 6.5% of dust mites.

* **Use the hottest dryer setting.** If bedding can't be washed hot, then put the items in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at a temperature at least 60ºC (140ºF).

* **Wash or dry duvets.** Duvets are a potential source of high concentrations of HDM allergens. Tumble drying a duvet for 1 hour on the maximum setting in a domestic clothes dryer (1800 W) with mean temperature 60°C kills nearly all the dust mites, but does not improve Der p 1 concentrations in duvet dust samples nor total dust weight.
