# Anaphylaxis emergency room

Anaphylaxis emergency hospital treatment in an emergency room, or emergency department, or by an emergency physician:

1. Administer adrenaline (a.k.a. epinepherine) if patient suspects anaphylaxis.

  * Administer adrenaline intramuscularly (IM) (Vasctus Lateralis muscle). Concentration is 1:10000 (1mg/1ml) solution - 0.3mg. May repeat in 15 minutes if needed.

  * Prefer preservative-free adrenaline (e.g. epinephrine).

  * Because of the risk of potentially lethal arrythmias, epinephrine should be administered IV only in profoundly hypotensive patients or patients in cardio/resperitory arrest who have failed to respond to IV volume replacement and several injected doses of epinephrine.

2. Administer oxygen.

3. Start large bore IV access.

4. If hypotensive, then administer IV fluids.

5. If wheezing is present, then consider inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators
Search instead for bronchodialotors (e.g. albuterol).

6. Administer H1 and H2 blockers as supportive therapy. Prefer IV administration. Include diphenhydramine as an H1 blocker, given 25mg-50mg (or hydroxyzine/fexofenadine), and 1mg/kg; given very slow IV diluted in normal saline over 2-5 minutes. H2 antagonist, Ranitidine/Cimetidein, IV, should also be given.

7. Administer corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) because they may prevent prolonged anaphylaxis.
