# Cortisol

Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. It plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress and is often referred to as the "stress hormone." Cortisol helps regulate a variety of physiological processes, including metabolism, immune response, and blood pressure. It also plays a vital part in the body's circadian rhythm, with levels typically peaking in the early morning and gradually declining throughout the day.

One of cortisol's primary functions is to provide the body with energy during stressful situations. It achieves this by increasing blood sugar levels through gluconeogenesis, the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources in the liver. Cortisol also helps mobilize fat stores and amino acids, providing additional energy sources. Additionally, cortisol has anti-inflammatory properties, which help to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. This is beneficial in the short term, but chronic high levels of cortisol can lead to immune suppression and increased susceptibility to illness.

Prolonged exposure to elevated cortisol levels, often due to chronic stress, can have various negative health effects. These include weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Conversely, insufficient cortisol production, as seen in conditions like Addison's disease, can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and low blood pressure.
