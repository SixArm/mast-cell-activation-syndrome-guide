# Histamine breakdown

Histamine is broken down in the body by two main enzymes: [diamine oxidase (DAO)](../diamine-oxidase/) and [histamine N-methyltransferase (HMT)](../histamine-n-methyltransferase/).

The following vitamins and nutrients support the activity of these enzymes, helping to break down histamine in the blood:

1. [Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)](../vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/): Acts as a cofactor for HMT, meaning B6 is necessary for HMT to function properly. Insufficient vitamin B6 reduces DAO activity, which reduces histamine breakdown.

2. [Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)](../vitamin-b12-cobalamin/): Plays a role in the metabolism of histamine and supports DAO function.

3. [Vitamin B9 (folate)](../vitamin-b9-folate/): Helps regulate histamine levels and supports DAO activity.

4. [Vitamin C (ascorbic-acid)](../vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid/): Boosts DAO enzyme activity, aiding in histamine breakdown.

5. [Copper](../copper/): Essential for DAO enzyme production and histamine degradation.

6. [Zinc]: Supports immune function and helps regulate histamine levels.

Individual needs may vary, and some people may require supplementation. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.
