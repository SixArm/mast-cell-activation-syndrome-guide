# Breath testing

Breath testing analyzes the gases produced in the digestive system. These tests are commonly employed to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), lactose intolerance, and Helicobacter pylori infection, among other conditions. Breath testing is non-invasive, simple to administer, provides rapid results, and is safer that alternatives such as endoscopy testing. However, preparation is crucial for accurate results, including fasting and avoiding certain foods and medications prior to the test.

**Examples**:

* **Hydrogen breath test**: used for diagnosing SIBO and carbohydrate malabsorption issues such as lactose intolerance. During the test, the patient ingests a specific sugar solution, such as lactulose or glucose for SIBO, or lactose for lactose intolerance. Bacteria in the small intestine metabolize these sugars, producing hydrogen and methane gases that are absorbed into the bloodstream and exhaled. Elevated levels of these gases, measured at regular intervals, indicate bacterial overgrowth or malabsorption.

* **Urea breath test**: used to detect H. pylori infection, a common cause of peptic ulcers. The patient consumes a urea solution labeled with a carbon isotope. If H. pylori is present in the stomach, it breaks down the urea, releasing carbon dioxide that contains the isotope. This labeled carbon dioxide is then measured in the patient's breath, confirming the presence of the bacteria.
