# Clemastine

Clemastine is a first-generation antihistamine medication used primarily for the treatment of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic conjunctivitis, and itching associated with chronic urticaria (hives). It provides rapid relief of symptoms but requires twice-daily dosing and may cause sedation and other CNS side effects. Patients should be advised to use caution when performing tasks requiring mental alertness.

**Key points**:

* **Mechanism of Action**: Clemastine belongs to the class of antihistamine drugs known as H1 receptor antagonists. It works by selectively blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, thereby alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, and watery eyes caused by allergic reactions.

* **Indications**: Clemastine is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial), allergic conjunctivitis, and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives) in adults and children aged 6 years and older. It is used to alleviate symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, runny nose, watery eyes, and skin rash or hives.

* **Dosage and Administration**: The usual dosage of clemastine for adults and children aged 12 years and older is 1 tablet (1.34 mg) taken orally every 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 6 tablets (8.04 mg). For children aged 6 to 11 years, the recommended dosage is half a tablet (0.67 mg) taken every 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 3 tablets (4.02 mg). Clemastine is typically taken with water, with or without food.

* **Onset and Duration of Action**: Clemastine has a relatively rapid onset of action, with symptom relief typically occurring within 1 hour after administration. The duration of action is generally 4 to 6 hours per dose, requiring twice-daily dosing for sustained relief of allergic symptoms.

* **Safety and Side Effects**: Clemastine is generally well-tolerated when used at recommended doses. However, like other first-generation antihistamines, it has a higher incidence of sedation and central nervous system (CNS) side effects compared to second-generation antihistamines. Common side effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention.

* **Contraindications**: Clemastine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients in the formulation. It should not be used in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, severe liver disease, or severe respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

* **Special Populations**: Clemastine should be used with caution in elderly patients, as they may be more susceptible to CNS side effects such as drowsiness and dizziness. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function in patients with impaired kidney function.
