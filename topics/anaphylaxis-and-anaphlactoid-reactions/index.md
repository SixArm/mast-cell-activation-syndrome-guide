# Anaphylaxis and anaphlactoid

Anaphylaxis and anaphlactoid are similar words for similar symptoms. The difference is whether there's an allergic reaction or not.

In an allergic reaction, there is an identifiable antigen. 

- The body's immune system recognizes the antigen, and binds it with an antibody called immunoglobin E (IgE). 

- The result is called an "antibody-antigen complex", and it triggers receptors on mast cells and basophils. 

- This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals into the body, and generates the hypersensitivity response. 

- If the reaction is localized, then it is stereotyped as an allergic reaction.

- If the reaction is systemic, then it is stereotyped as an anaphylactic reaction a.ka. anaphylaxis.

In contrast, an anaphylactoid reaction occurs without an identifiable antigen.

- An anaphylactoid reaction does generate mast cell (or basophil) degranulation.

- And does have many of the same signs, symptoms, and responses, as anaphylaxis.

- But does not create an "antibody-antigen complex" so cannot be detected by many allergy tests.

- Examples are MCAS reactions to sunshine, or heat, or vibration, or foods that don't cause IgE binding.

Many adverse reactions to drugs, or drug hypersensitivies, are actually anaphylactoid reactions and not true allergies.
