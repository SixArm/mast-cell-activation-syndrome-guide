# Anaphylaxis and anaphlactoid

Anaphylaxis and anaphlactoid are similar words for similar symptoms. The difference is whether there's an allergic reaction or not.

In an allergic reaction, there is an identifiable antigen. 

- The body's immune system recognizes the antigen, and binds it with an antibody called immunoglobin E (IgE). 

- The result is called an "antibody-antigen complex", and it triggers receptors on mast cells and basophils. 

- This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals into the body, and generates the hypersensitivity response. 

Signs, symptoms, and responses are stereotyped based on the location of the reaction.

- If the reaction is localized, then it is stereotyped as an allergic reaction.

- If the reaction is systemic, then it is stereotyped as anaphylaxis. 

In contrast, an anaphylactoid reaction occurs in the absence of an antibody-antigen complex. 

- An anaphylactoid reaction does generate mast cell (or basophil) degranulation.

- And does have many of the same signs, symptoms, and responses, as anaphylaxis.

Many adverse reactions to drugs, or drug hypersensitivies, are actually anaphylactoid reactions and not true allergies.
