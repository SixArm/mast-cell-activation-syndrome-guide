# Parsley herbal infusion

[Source: Healing Histamine](https://www.healinghistamine.com/blog/5-best-histamine-intolerance-teas/)

Parsley has both anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic properties. Studies show it inhibits histamine release from mast cells. Parsley also contains apigenin, a bioflavonoid that has been shown to prevent histamine release from basophil white blood cells.

Parsley tea is easy to make with either the fresh leaf or the dried herb.

**Ingredients**:

* 30 grams of parsley leaves (fresh or dried)
* 4 cups of water

**Instructions**:

* Remove fresh parsley leaves from the stems and measure out 30 grams. (Or measure out dried).
* Bring the water to a boil in a deep saucepan.
* Add the parsley leaves to the water for about 1 minute before taking the pan off the heat.
* Steep for approximately 10 minutes.
* Strain into a cup and add honey or lemon to taste, if desired.
