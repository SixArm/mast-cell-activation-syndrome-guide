# Cooking triggers

Cooking triggers can include any of these:

* **What you cook**: Foods, beverages, spices, and ingredients can contain histamine, or allergens, or cross-contaminations, or mast cell activation triggers that are independent of any allergies.

* **Heat**: Heat in the kitchen can be a trigger for mast cell activation. You can try using a portable kitchen fan, or a kitchen exhaust fan, or a stove-top hood fan.

* **Gas**: Gas from stoves can be a mast cell activation trigger. You may want to try switching from a gas stove to a portable induction stove, which can plug in to any typical outlet, and cook without using gas.
  
* **Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)**: Cooking can release VOCs that irritate airways and can trigger mast cell activation. You can try using a table-top VOC air filter to use right by the stove, or a VOC detector to use right by the stove.

* **Microparticles**: Many non-stick pans can release microparticles, such as microplastics and microshards of chemicals. For example, a typical Teflon pan that has as scratch can pollute your food. Some people get some relief by switching from low-budget non-stick pans to ferritic non-nickel stainless steel pans, which work with any stove and also with a portable induction stove, and which do not contain plastics nor nickel.
