# Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a serious tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium *Rickettsia rickettsii*. This infection is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, or brown dog tick. RMSF is prevalent in the United States, particularly in the southeastern and south-central regions, but cases have been reported across the country.

The symptoms of RMSF typically begin within 2 to 14 days after a tick bite. Early signs include sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle pain, and nausea. One of the hallmark features of RMSF is a distinctive rash, which usually appears a few days after the fever starts. The rash often begins as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots on the wrists, forearms, and ankles, and can spread to the trunk, palms, and soles. In severe cases, the rash may become petechial, characterized by small red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin.

RMSF can be life-threatening if not treated promptly, leading to complications such as damage to blood vessels, which can cause bleeding or clotting issues, and potentially affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice and is most effective when administered within the first five days of symptoms. It is recommended for both adults and children.

Preventing RMSF involves avoiding tick-infested areas, using tick repellents, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors. Removing ticks promptly can reduce the risk of transmission. Awareness and education about tick bite prevention and recognizing early symptoms of RMSF are key to reducing the incidence and severity of this potentially fatal disease.
