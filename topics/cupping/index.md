# Cupping

Cupping is a [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](../traditional-chinese-medicine/) practice that involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. The suction is typically created by heating the air inside the cup or by using a vacuum pump. Cupping is used for pain relief, promoting relaxation, and improving overall well-being.

**Key points**:

* **Therapeutic Claims**: Proponents of cupping claim various therapeutic benefits, including pain relief, improved circulation, reduction of inflammation, and relaxation.

* **Dry or Wet**:  In dry cupping, cups are placed on the skin, and suction is created to draw the skin and superficial muscle layer into the cup. In wet cupping, small incisions are made in the skin, and suction is applied to draw a small amount of blood.

* **Traditional Medicine**: Cupping has roots in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is believed to promote the flow of qi (energy) and balance the body's yin and yang. It is also practiced in other traditional medicine systems, including Ayurveda and Middle Eastern traditional medicine.

* **Markings on the Skin**: The circular markings left on the skin after cupping are often temporary and typically fade within a few days.

* **Safety and Considerations**: Cupping should be performed by trained and qualified practitioners to ensure safety and effectiveness. Individuals with certain skin conditions, bleeding disorders, or those taking anticoagulant medications should consult with healthcare professionals before undergoing cupping.

* **Research Gaps**: While there is some research on cupping, more high-quality studies are needed to establish its effectiveness for specific health conditions and to understand its mechanisms of action.
