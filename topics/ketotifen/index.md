# Ketotifen

Ketotifen is a medication that has several medical uses, primarily as an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. It is available in various forms, including oral tablets and eye drops, and it is used to manage various conditions.

In the United States, see brand name Zaditor.

Ketotifen works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical that the body releases during an allergic reaction. Additionally, as a mast cell stabilizer, it helps prevent mast cells from releasing histamine and other inflammatory mediators, reducing inflammation and symptoms.

**Primary uses:**

* **Allergic Conditions**: Ketotifen is commonly used as an oral antihistamine to relieve symptoms associated with allergies. It can help reduce symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and itching of the throat or nose.

* **Asthma Management**: Ketotifen is used as a mast cell stabilizer and may be prescribed to help manage asthma symptoms in some individuals. It can help prevent asthma attacks by reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airways.

* **Allergic Conjunctivitis**: Ketotifen is available in eye drop form and is used to relieve itching and redness in the eyes caused by allergic conjunctivitis, also known as eye allergies.

* **Eosinophilic Esophagitis**: Ketotifen has been investigated for its use in managing eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic inflammatory condition of the esophagus. It may help reduce the number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the esophagus and alleviate related symptoms.
