# Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR)

Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) are transcription factors that play a critical role in the body's response to environmental toxins, specifically aromatic hydrocarbons. AhR activation is involved in regulating the expression of a wide range of genes.

**Key points**:

* **Ligand Activation**: AhRs are typically inactive in the absence of ligands. They become activated when they bind to specific ligands, many of which are environmental pollutants.

* **Xenobiotic Metabolism**: AhR activation induces the expression of enzymes involved in xenobiotic (foreign substance) metabolism. This helps the body process and eliminate potentially harmful substances.

* **Detoxification**: AhRs regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for detoxifying and breaking down a wide range of chemicals, including drugs and toxins.

* **Immune Regulation**: AhRs are involved in immune system regulation and have been linked to the development of immune cells and immune responses.

* **Development and Tissue Homeostasis**: AhRs play a role in various developmental processes, including cardiovascular development, and are implicated in maintaining tissue homeostasis.

* **Cross-Talk with Other Pathways**: AhRs can interact with other cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in inflammation and oxidative stress.

* **Nutrition and Diet**: Some dietary compounds, such as those found in cruciferous vegetables, can activate AhRs and have been associated with potential health benefits.
