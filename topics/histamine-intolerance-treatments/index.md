# Histamine intolerance: treatments

Histamine intolerance treatment typically involve identifying and addressing factors that contribute to histamine accumulation and symptoms.

**Common approaches:**

* **Identify Triggers:** Keep a diary to track symptoms and identify specific triggers, such as foods, pollens, or chemicals.

* **Low-Histamine Diet:** Adopt a low-histamine diet to reducing the intake of foods rich in histamine.

* **Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Supplements:** DAO is the enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract.

* **Probiotics:** Probiotic supplements or foods rich in probiotics may be beneficial to maintain a healthy gut.

* **Address Gut Issues:** Treat conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or leaky gut syndrome.

* **Antihistamine Medications:** Use medications such as cetirizine (H1 blocker) or ranitidine (H2 blocker).

* **Avoid Alcohol:** Limit alcohol because it can interfere with histamine metabolism and contribute to symptom exacerbation.

* **Avoid Trigger Medications:** Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some prescription medications, can contribute to histamine release.

* **Reduce Stress:** Stress can trigger or exacerbate symptoms. Try meditation, deep breathing, yoga, and relaxation exercises.

* **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water helps flush toxins and excess histamine.

* **Liver Support:** Try dietary or lifestyle practices to help liver function. The liver plays a role in histamine metabolism.
