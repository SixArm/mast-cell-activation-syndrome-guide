# Histamine intolerance: treatments

Histamine intolerance treatment typically involve identifying and addressing factors that contribute to histamine accumulation and symptoms.

**Common approaches**:

* **Identify Triggers**: Keep a diary to track symptoms and identify specific triggers, such as foods, pollens, or chemicals. 

* **Low-Histamine Diet**: Adopt a low-histamine diet to reducing the intake of foods rich in histamine.

* **Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Supplements**: DAO is the enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract.
  
* **Probiotics**: Probiotic supplements or foods rich in probiotics, such as yogurt and kefir, may be beneficial to maintain a healthy gut microbial profile.

* **Address Gut Issues**: Treating conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or leaky gut syndrome can improve histamine metabolism.

* **Antihistamine Medications**: Use over-the-counter antihistamine medications, such as cetirizine (H1 blocker) or ranitidine (H2 blocker).

* **Avoid Alcohol**: Limit alcohol because it can interfere with histamine metabolism and contribute to symptom exacerbation.
  
* **Avoid Trigger Medications**: Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some prescription medications, can contribute to histamine release.

* **Reduce Stress**: Stress can trigger or exacerbate symptoms. Try meditation, deep breathing, yoga, and relaxation exercises.

* **Hydrate**: Drinking plenty of water helps flush out toxins, including excess histamine.
  
* **Liver Support**: Some individuals explore dietary or lifestyle practices aimed at supporting liver function, as the liver plays a role in histamine metabolism.
