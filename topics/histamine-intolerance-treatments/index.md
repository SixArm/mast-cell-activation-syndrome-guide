# Histamine intolerance: treatments

Histamine intolerance treatment typically involve identifying and addressing factors that contribute to histamine accumulation and symptoms. While there is no cure for histamine intolerance, various strategies can be employed to alleviate symptoms and improve overall well-being. 

Common approaches:

* Identify Triggers: Keep a diary to track symptoms and identify specific triggers, such as foods, pollens, or chemicals. 

* Low-Histamine Diet: Adopt a low-histamine diet to reducing the intake of foods rich in histamine. This may include avoiding or minimizing certain foods and beverages known to be high in histamine.

* Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Supplements: DAO is the enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract. DAO supplements are available.
  
* Probiotics: Maintaining a healthy balance of gut bacteria may support overall digestive health and help regulate histamine levels. Probiotic supplements or foods rich in probiotics, such as yogurt and kefir, may be beneficial.
 
* Address Gut Issues: Addressing conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or leaky gut syndrome can contribute to improved histamine metabolism.

* Antihistamine Medications: Over-the-counter antihistamine medications, such as cetirizine (H1 blocker) or ranitidine (H2 blocker), may help alleviate symptoms.

* Avoid Alcohol: Alcohol can interfere with histamine metabolism and contribute to symptom exacerbation. Limiting or avoiding alcohol intake may be beneficial.
  
* Avoid Trigger Medications: Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some prescription medications, can contribute to histamine release.

* Reduce Stress: Stress can trigger or exacerbate histamine intolerance symptoms. Practices such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga may help manage stress and support overall well-being.

* Hydrate: Drinking plenty of water helps flush out toxins, including excess histamine.
  
* Liver Support: Some individuals explore dietary or lifestyle practices aimed at supporting liver function, as the liver plays a role in histamine metabolism.

* Ask Professionals: Allergists, immunologists, or registered dietitians, can aid in diagnosis and treatment.
