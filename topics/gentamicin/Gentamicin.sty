# Gentamicin

Gentamicin is a potent antibiotic belonging to the aminoglycoside class, widely
used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It
is particularly effective against infections such as sepsis, respiratory tract
infections, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections. Gentamicin works
by binding to bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis, and leading to
bacterial cell death.

Administered primarily via intravenous or intramuscular injection, gentamicin
reaches high concentrations in bodily tissues and fluids, making it effective
for severe infections. Due to its potency, the dosage and duration of gentamicin
treatment are carefully determined based on the severity of the infection,
kidney function, and patient-specific factors. Therapeutic drug monitoring is
often employed to maintain effective blood levels while minimizing the risk of
toxicity.

Despite its effectiveness, gentamicin has notable side effects, particularly
nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) and ototoxicity (hearing loss or balance issues).
These risks necessitate careful monitoring of kidney function and auditory
function during treatment. The risk of toxicity is higher with prolonged use or
in patients with preexisting kidney conditions.

In addition to its systemic use, gentamicin is available in topical formulations
for treating localized skin infections and in ophthalmic preparations for eye
infections. Its broad-spectrum activity and rapid bactericidal action make it a
valuable tool in the management of severe bacterial infections, provided that
its use is judiciously monitored to prevent adverse effects.
