# GHK-CU peptide

GHK-CU peptide, also known as copper peptide, is a naturally occurring tripeptide composed of glycine, histidine, and lysine, with a strong affinity for copper ions. This peptide plays a significant role in various biological processes, including wound healing, tissue repair, and the regulation of inflammation. It is found in human plasma, saliva, and urine, and its levels decrease with age.

One of the primary functions of GHK-CU is to stimulate the production of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, essential components of the skin's extracellular matrix. This makes it highly effective in promoting skin regeneration and reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Additionally, GHK-CU has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties, helping to soothe irritated skin and accelerate the healing of wounds and skin lesions.

GHK-CU also exhibits antioxidant effects, protecting cells from oxidative stress and free radical damage. This property, combined with its ability to enhance skin elasticity and firmness, has led to its widespread use in anti-aging skincare products. Furthermore, research indicates that GHK-CU can improve hair growth by stimulating hair follicle cells, making it a valuable ingredient in hair care formulations.

Beyond cosmetic applications, GHK-CU has potential therapeutic benefits for tissue repair and regeneration in conditions such as chronic wounds, ulcers, and even certain degenerative diseases. While generally considered safe, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before using GHK-CU-based products, especially for individuals with specific health conditions or sensitivities.
