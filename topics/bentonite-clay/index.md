# Bentonite clay

Bentonite clay is a natural clay formed from the weathering of volcanic ash in the presence of water. Rich in minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, it has been used for centuries for its detoxifying and healing properties. When hydrated, Bentonite clay becomes negatively charged, allowing it to attract and bind positively charged toxins, heavy metals, and impurities, making it a popular ingredient in detox and skincare products.

Bentonite clay is used internally for detoxification purposes. When ingested, it can bind to toxins and support the bodyâ€™s natural elimination processes. Some people use it to alleviate digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and constipation. However, internal use of Bentonite clay should be approached with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as improper use can lead to nutrient deficiencies or intestinal blockages.

In skincare, Bentonite clay is renowned for its ability to deeply cleanse and purify the skin. It effectively absorbs excess oil and sebum, unclogs pores, and removes dead skin cells, making it a beneficial treatment for acne and oily skin. The clay's soothing properties can also help reduce inflammation and irritation, promoting a clearer and healthier complexion. Regular use of Bentonite clay masks can leave the skin feeling soft, smooth, and rejuvenated.
