# Graded Exercise Therapy (GET)

Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) is an approach to managing certain medical conditions, particularly Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). It is a structured and gradual exercise program to help individuals gradually increase their physical activity levels.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: The primary goal is to improve a person's physical function, to address the deconditioning and physical limitations associated with medical conditions.

* **Structure**: GET involves a carefully planned and gradual increase in physical activity over time. It starts with activities that are well-tolerated and gradually progresses.

* **Individualized**: GET is tailored to the individual's specific abilities, taking into account their baseline fitness level, symptoms, and limitations.

* **Supervised or Self-Guided**: GET can be supervised by a healthcare professional, such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, or it can be guided as a self-help program.

* **Pacing**: GET involves finding a balance between activity and rest to prevent overexertion and a crash in symptoms.

* **Controversy**: GET has been a topic of controversy. Some patients report benefits, while others argue that it can exacerbate symptoms.

* **Patient-Centered Care**: Successful implementation of GET requires a patient-centered approach, taking into consideration the individual's preferences, concerns, and feedback throughout the process.
