# Frequency-specific microcurrent (FSM)

Frequency-specific microcurrent (FSM) uses low-level electrical currents to target specific tissues and physiological processes in the body. These currents are thought to mimic the body's natural electrical signals and may help restore normal cellular function, reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and relieve pain.

* **Pain management**: It may relieve muscle pain, nerve pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other conditions. It may reduce inflammation, relax muscles, and stimulate the release of endorphins, which are natural pain-relieving chemicals produced by the body.

* **Injury recovery**: It may promote tissue healing and regeneration by enhancing cellular repair processes, increasing blood flow to injured tissues, and reducing scar tissue formation.

* **Neurological conditions**: It may help improve nerve function, reduce nerve pain, and restore neurological balance.

* **Digestive disorders**: It may help regulate digestive motility, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating.

* **Women's health**: It may help regulate hormonal function, reduce menstruation paint, and reduce menopause symptoms.
