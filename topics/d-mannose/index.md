# D-mannose

D-mannose is a naturally occurring simple sugar related to glucose, commonly found in fruits such as cranberries, apples, and peaches. It has gained popularity as a dietary supplement primarily for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly those caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.

The primary mechanism by which D-mannose works involves preventing the adherence of E. coli bacteria to the walls of the urinary tract. E. coli bacteria use tiny hair-like structures called fimbriae to attach to the urinary tract lining. D-mannose molecules attach to these fimbriae, blocking the bacteria's ability to adhere to the urinary tract lining. As a result, the bacteria are flushed out of the urinary system during urination, reducing the risk of infection and aiding in the resolution of existing infections.

Clinical studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that D-mannose can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of UTIs, particularly in individuals who suffer from recurrent infections. It is considered a safe alternative to antibiotics, which are commonly used to treat UTIs but can lead to antibiotic resistance and disrupt the balance of beneficial bacteria in the body.

D-mannose is available in powder, capsule, and tablet forms and is typically taken with water. While generally well-tolerated, some people may experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating or diarrhea, when taking D-mannose.
