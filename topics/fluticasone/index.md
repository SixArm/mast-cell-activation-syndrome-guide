# Fluticasone

Fluticasone is a corticosteroid medication widely used to treat various inflammatory conditions. It is available in several forms, including nasal sprays, inhalers, and topical creams. Each form of fluticasone is designed to target specific conditions, such as allergic rhinitis (nasal spray), asthma (inhaler), and skin inflammation (topical cream).

As a corticosteroid, fluticasone works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response. When used as a nasal spray, it helps alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis, such as sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion. For asthma, fluticasone inhalers reduce airway inflammation, helping to prevent asthma attacks and improve breathing. Topical fluticasone is applied directly to the skin to relieve inflammation and itching associated with conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

Fluticasone is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause side effects, especially with long-term use. Common side effects of nasal sprays include nasal irritation and nosebleeds, while inhalers may cause oral thrush, hoarseness, and throat irritation. Topical fluticasone can lead to skin thinning and increased susceptibility to skin infections. It is important to use fluticasone as directed by a healthcare provider to minimize these risks.
