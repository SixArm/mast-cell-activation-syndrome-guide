**Borrelia:**

* **Transmission**: Lyme disease is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected black-legged ticks.

* **Symptoms**: An initial skin rash called erythema migrans, fever, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and, if untreated, more severe symptoms affecting the joints, nervous system, and other organs.

**Bartonella:**

* **Transmission**: Bartonella bacteria are often associated with vectors like fleas, ticks, lice, and cat scratches and bites.

* **Symptoms**: Swollen lymph nodes, fever, and fatigue.

* **Care**: Diagnosis uses serological tests, molecular diagnostics, and clinical evaluation. Treatment uses antibiotics.

**Babesia:**

* **Transmission**: Babesia is a protozoan parasite that is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected ticks.

* **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, fatigue, and anemia. Severe cases can occur, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems.
