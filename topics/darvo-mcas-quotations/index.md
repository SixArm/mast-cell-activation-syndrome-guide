# DARVO MCAS quotations

"After my appointment, I'm feeling terrible and like I don't want to go back. The
doctor gaslit me and invalidated my struggles or pushed back on everything I
said for the entire hour appointment. They stated "people with mast cell" are
"on the couch" as if I'm not suffering enough to possibly have MCAS. And they
don't even know my life or what I go through."

"I'm so upset and I'm so tired of being treated with complete disrespect from
people who are supposed to be improving my life. I just needed to vent in a
(hopefully) safe space. I haven't been able to stop mulling over this in my head
because I just convinced myself I meet enough criteria to try and get MCAS
diagnosed and now I'm doubting that again because of their crappy behavior
towards me."
