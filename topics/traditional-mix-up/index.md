# Traditional mix-up

The word "traditional" in medicine has a mix-up because it has two opposite meanings.

The word "traditional" can mean traditional indigenous treatments throughout history:

* Traditional Chinese practices can use medicine such as [acupuncture](../acupuncture/) and derivatives such as [Soliman Auricular Allergy Treatment](../soliman-auricular-allergy-treatment/).

* Traditional Egyptian practices can use herbs such as [khellin](../khellin/) and derivatives such as [cromolyn sodium](../cromolyn-sodium/).

* Traditional Inuit practices can use a [carnivore diet](../carnivore-diet/) plentiful in fish oils and derivatives such as [omega-3](../omega-3/).

The word "traditional" can mean traditional in the sense of allopathic medical training:

* Traditional allopathic studies are when medicine is taught at colleges and university through lectures, seminars, practicals. Focus is per topic, such as per organ e.g. the heart, or specialization e.g. cardiology, or treatment e.g. atorvastatins.

* Traditional scientific methods are when researchers make conjectures (i.e. hypothetical explanations), derive predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, then carry out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.

* Traditional medical licenses are exemplified by the Medical Doctor (MD) license in the United States. The license is awarded based on a standardized examination exemplified by the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).
