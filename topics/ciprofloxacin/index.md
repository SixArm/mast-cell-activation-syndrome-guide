# Ciprofloxacin

Ciprofloxacin (brand name Cipro) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the fluoroquinolone class, widely used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is effective against numerous gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria, making it suitable for treating respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, skin infections, and certain types of bacterial diarrhea, including that caused by Escherichia coli and Salmonella.

Ciprofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes crucial for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By disrupting these processes, ciprofloxacin prevents bacterial cell division and leads to cell death. This mechanism of action makes it a powerful tool against bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics.

Available in multiple forms, including tablets, oral suspension, and intravenous solution, ciprofloxacin offers versatility in administration depending on the infection's severity and location. The typical dosage and duration of treatment vary based on the specific infection and patient characteristics, including kidney function.

While ciprofloxacin is generally well-tolerated, it can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and headaches. More serious side effects include tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects like seizures and confusion. Due to these risks, ciprofloxacin should be used cautiously, especially in populations at higher risk for tendon damage, such as older adults and those on corticosteroids.

Ciprofloxacin's effectiveness can be compromised by bacterial resistance, a significant concern in clinical practice. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to use the antibiotic only when prescribed and to adhere to the complete course of treatment.
