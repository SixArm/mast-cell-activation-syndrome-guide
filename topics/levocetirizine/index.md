**Key points:**

* **Action**: Levocetirizine works by blocking the action of histamine, a natural substance in the body that is involved in allergic reactions. It acts as a selective antagonist at the histamine H1 receptor.

* **Indications**: Levocetirizine is used for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic conditions, including allergic rhinitis (hay fever), chronic idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives), and allergic conjunctivitis.

* **Forms**: It is available in various forms, including oral tablets and oral solutions.

* **Timing**: Levocetirizine generally has a rapid onset of action, and its effects can last for 24 hours. It is often taken once daily.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects may include drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. Most people tolerate levocetirizine well, and serious side effects are rare.

* **Effect on Cognitive Function**: Levocetirizine is considered a non-sedating antihistamine, meaning it is less likely to cause sedation compared to some other [antihistamines](../antihistamines/). However, individual responses may vary, and caution is advised, especially when performing activities that require mental alertness.
