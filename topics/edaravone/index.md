# Edaravone

TODO

Edaravone (brand name Radicava) is a medication used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. ALS leads to the gradual loss of muscle control, resulting in severe disability and, eventually, death. Edaravone is one of the few treatments available that can slow the progression of this debilitating condition.

Edaravone works by scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress, which is believed to play a critical role in the neuronal damage seen in ALS. By mitigating oxidative stress, edaravone helps protect nerve cells from further damage, potentially preserving motor function for a longer period.

Edaravone is administered through intravenous infusion, typically given in cycles. The initial treatment involves daily infusions for 14 days followed by a two-week drug-free period. Subsequent cycles consist of daily infusions for 10 out of 14 days, repeated every four weeks. This regimen requires administration in a clinical setting, ensuring proper monitoring for any adverse reactions.

Clinical trials have shown that edaravone can slow the decline in physical function in ALS patients, offering a crucial option for managing this challenging disease. Common side effects include bruising, gait disturbance, and headaches, while more serious risks include hypersensitivity reactions.
