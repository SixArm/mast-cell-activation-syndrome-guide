# Functional medicine - provider rubric

These are my notes about how I choose a function provider based on four short competency questions that I believe are especially important for mast cell issues. These notes are based on my own interactions with hundreds of providers over years, learning what helps and what causes errors.

Your experience may vary. Other patients and practitioners may have very different opinions, and that's OK. Learn from all the opinions, so you find what's best for you. Feedback welcome.

When a provider uses a term like "root cause", ask their opinion of root cause analysis with CAST.

* Good looks like them knowing CAST and using it for you. CAST is Causal Analysis based on System Theory, and it is what professional use for multiple root causes that interact with each other and the holistic system. CAST is a very strong tool for MCAS.

* Bad looks like: "I've never used CAST" or the oversimplification "one root cause can cause many symptoms, or many root causes can cause one condition".

When a provider uses a term like "all the best tests", ask which allergy tests they use often.

* Good looks like: starting with ISAC molecular blood testing and staying on your meds.

* Bad looks like: starting with any test that would need you to go off your meds.

When a provider uses the term "functional medicine", ask their opinion of traditional medicine.

* Good looks like: favoring trying traditional medicine to see if it helps. Examples are traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture and SAAT, traditional Egyptian medicine such as khellin and cromolyn, traditional Inuit medicine such fish oil and omega-3, etc.

* Bad looks like: anything that talks down at traditional medicine, rather than trying it to help you get better.

When a provider uses a term like "detailed intake" or "full history", ask them to put in writing that your data is solely for the provider's eyes only for one-on-one treatment, and never for the provider's vendors for advertising, marketing, promotion, aggregation, or anonymization.

* Good looks like: the provider puts it in writing. It's fine if the provider can clarify that your data needs to go to/from your other direct providers and your direct insurance company for claims; this is fine. If your provider is in the U.S. and uses Epic, that's a fine choice.

* Bad looks like: any hemming and hawing; any requests to have you sign disclosures or consent forms or advertising/marketing/promotion permissions; anything that has you sign up for a web portal that has any agreement that shows you terms and conditions to sign that says "advertising" or "marketing" or "promotion" or "aggregation" or "anonymization". If your provider uses SimplePractice or Elevate Health then veto.
