# Nickel allergy

Nickel allergy, also known as nickel dermatitis, is a common allergic skin reaction to nickel, a metal that is widely used in various consumer products. Nickel is found in items such as jewelry (particularly earrings and other metal accessories), watches, eyeglass frames, buttons, zippers, belt buckles, and some tools and utensils.

* **Action**: Nickel allergy is a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction, meaning that the allergic response typically develops hours to days after exposure to nickel. Once sensitized to nickel, individuals with nickel allergy may continue to experience symptoms upon subsequent exposures, even to small amounts of nickel.

* **Symptoms**: Nickel allergy often causes intense itching, which can be bothersome and uncomfortable. A rash may develop in the area of skin that came into contact with nickel. In some cases, the skin reaction may progress to the formation of small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) or papules. The skin may become swollen or puffy, particularly if the reaction is severe or prolonged.

* **Treatment**: Minimize exposure. Take precautions when handling items that may contain nickel, such as wearing gloves. Choose jewelry and accessories made from materials that are less likely to contain nickel, such as stainless steel, titanium, gold, or platinum. Avoid clothing with metal fasteners, buttons, or snaps that may contain nickel. Use protective barriers, such as clear nail polish or protective covers, on items that may contain nickel (e.g., jewelry).
