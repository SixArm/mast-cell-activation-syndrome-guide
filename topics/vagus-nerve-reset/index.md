# Vagus nerve reset

The vagus nerve, which is the longest cranial nerve in the body, has sensory and motor functions. It is involved in the regulation of various bodily functions, including heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and more. Stimulating the vagus nerve can have various effects, and there are practices and techniques that some people refer to as "vagus nerve resets" or ways to activate and modulate the vagus nerve.

**Key points:**

* **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing can stimulate the vagus nerve and promote a relaxation response.

* **Meditation and Mindfulness:** Practices that focus on mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation may positively influence the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system.

* **Cold Exposure:** Exposure to cold, such as cold water immersion or cold showers, has been suggested to activate the vagus nerve.

* **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** In a medical context, vagus nerve stimulation is an approved treatment for certain medical conditions, including epilepsy and depression. A device delivers electrical impulses to the vagus nerve.

* **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise, especially activities like yoga, which incorporate breath control, can have positive effects on vagal tone.

* **Gargling:** Gargling with water may stimulate the vagus nerve, as it involves muscles connected to the vagus nerve.

* **Laughter:** Laughter and positive social interactions may influence the vagus nerve and contribute to a sense of well-being.
