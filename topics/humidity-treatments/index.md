Humidity in the home can lead to mold and mildew.

* **Buy a humidity monitor**: Measure the moisture levels of the air in your home so you know what you’re dealing with.
  
* **Use a dehumidifier**: A dehumidifier is designed to fit inside your furnace air handler and to remove moisture from air as it passes through. This handy tool will help keep your home dry and cool.

* **Use a ventilation fan**: When you’re cooking, showering, or doing any other activity that introduces heat into your home, use a ventilation fan  to increase airflow and decrease humidity.
  
* **Use an air conditioner**: An air conditioner will naturally decrease the humidity in your home by removing warm air and introducing cool air. Make sure you change the AC filter frequently to maximize the airflow.

* **Take cooler showers**: Hot showers can introduce a lot of humidity into an environment. Cooler showers decrease the amount of steam in the air and thus, humidity levels overall.

* **Fix leaks**: Leaky pipes and faucets add moisture. Repair any leaks or drips in your home, and consider wrapping any exposed pipes in insulators in order to discourage condensation from forming.

* **Dry clothes outdoors**: Rather than dry your laundry indoors, try drying it outside. Particularly in warm months, wet clothes add humidity to the air that can result in unpleasant living conditions. Use a clothesline or an outdoor drying rack.

* **Move your plants**: Houseplants release moisture into the air, so if you have a lot of them, they could be contributing to the humidity of your home. Try moving them outside, at least temporarily.
  
* **Use charcoal**: Charcoal will suck the moisture out of the air and absorb it. Simply place a few briquettes in a container like a basket or a can and replace them every couple of months.

* **Open the windows**: Even if it’s humid outside, opening the windows can help dehumidify your home since moving air will discourage moisture-filled air from settling in your home. 
  
* **Smell your carpets and rugs**: Carpets and rugs can absorb a lot of moisture. If yours smell like mold, mildew or fungus, then clean them, or eliminate them.

* **Use rock salt**: You can make your own dehumidifier using rock salt, also known as halite. It’s readily available online and at your local home goods store, and it can be a handy tool for absorbing moisture.
  
* **Use baking soda**: Place bowls of the baking soda in areas of your house where humidity is high. Baking soda works best in smaller rooms, so use charcoal or rock salt if you’re working with a larger area.
  
* **Try cat litter**: Silica-based cat litter absorbs plenty of moisture from the air.
  
* **Install a vapor barrier**: If you have a crawl space, moisture from the soil might be entering your home, increasing the humidity level at large. You can install a vapor barrier over the soil to prevent humidity from entering your living space.
  
* **Cover your pots**: When possible, use a pot lid to cover your pots when cooking. This will prevent vapor from entering the air in your home.

* **Leave interior doors open**: This improves air circulation.

* **Try weatherstripping**: When you weatherstrip around your windows and doors, you create an airtight seal that prevents humidity from outside seeping into your home. You can buy a weatherstripping kit, or just adhesive-backed foam, online or at your local home goods store.

* **Check your gutters**: Check that your gutter downspout is turned away from your home and extended at least six feet away from your home.
