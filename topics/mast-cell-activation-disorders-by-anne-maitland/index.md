This video shows a Division of Gastroenterology Grand Rounds presented by Anne Maitland, MD, PhD, Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine (Clinical Immunology), Assistant Director, 3 Pillars Therapeutics and Comprehensive Allergy & Asthma Care.

This video is suitable for beginner medical students, or doctors who want a one-hour introduction to mast cell disorder issues and current usable research for patient treatments.

Dr. Maitland describes how mast cell disorders are coming to the forefront of medical students, who need to understand the pathology of delayed and immediate hypersensitivity disorders. The doctor describes that one out of five individuals at one point in time will have a mast cell disorder, and that dysregulation can cause pathology anywhere in the body with symptoms.

The doctor discusses mast cell disorder testing, including serum tryptase tests, prostaglandin tests, plasma histamine tests, and emergency room tests.

The video has compelling new information about individuals that were being evaluated for suspected mast cell disorders, and they were actually found to have idiopathic cd4 lymphocytopenia. So in many ways individuals that have either cutaneous signs or gastrointestinal signs of dysregulation.
