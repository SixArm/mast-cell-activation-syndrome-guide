# Vitamin C

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. It is an essential nutrient, meaning the human body cannot produce it on its own.

**Key aspects:**

* **Antioxidant Properties:** Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which means it helps protect cells from oxidative damage.

* **Immune Support:** Vitamin C helps stimulate the production of white blood cells, enhances the function of immune cells, and helps defend against infections.

* **Collagen Production:** Vitamin C essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that plays a key role in wound healing, skin health, bone health, and tissue health.

* **Absorption of Iron:** Vitamin C enhances the digestive absorption of non-heme iron (the type of iron found in plant-based foods). This helps prevent iron-deficiency anemia.

* **Neurotransmitter Synthesis:** Vitamin C helps the synthesis of neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine.

* **Skin Health:** Vitamin C is used in skincare products to promote healthy skin and reduce signs of aging.

* **Dietary Sources:** Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits), berries (strawberries, blueberries), kiwi, guava, papaya, red and green bell peppers, and broccoli.

* **Deficiency:** Severe deficiency leads to scurvy, fatigue, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, and skin conditions.

* **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA):** 65-90 milligrams per day for adults. Higher during pregnancy and lactation.
