# Dried urine testing

TODO

Studies show that urine is just as effective for measuring cortisol and DHEA levels, and itâ€™s also simple enough for patients to collect multiple times per day.

Due to the nature of the sample collection, there are some difference between saliva and urine testing for diurnal cortisol.

The added benefit to dried urine testing is that epinephrine and norepinephrine can be measured at the same time, so patients who want a complete adrenal assessment can now get all four key markers together.
