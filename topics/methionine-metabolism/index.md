# Methionine metabolism

Methionine metabolism, also known as the methionine cycle, is a vital biochemical process involving the essential amino acid methionine, which plays a crucial role in various cellular functions. Methionine is obtained from dietary proteins and is integral to the synthesis of proteins and other important molecules in the body.

One of the primary pathways of methionine metabolism is the methionine cycle, which begins with methionine being converted into S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a universal methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions. These methylation processes are essential for the modification of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids, influencing gene expression, protein function, and membrane integrity.

After donating its methyl group, SAMe is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is subsequently hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Homocysteine can either be remethylated back to methionine or enter the transsulfuration pathway, where it is converted into cysteine, a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is a critical antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and maintains redox balance.

Methionine metabolism is tightly regulated, as imbalances can lead to health issues. Elevated homocysteine levels, for example, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and other health problems. Ensuring adequate intake of vitamins B6, B12, and folate is crucial, as they act as cofactors in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, thus maintaining the balance of this metabolic pathway.
