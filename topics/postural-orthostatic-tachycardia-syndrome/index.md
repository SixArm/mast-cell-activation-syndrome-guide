# Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a form of dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. POTS primarily affects the cardiovascular system, causing an abnormal increase in heart rate when transitioning from lying down to standing up.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: Abnormally high heart rate (tachycardia) when moving from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. Orthostatic intolerance, which means dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting when standing, due to blood pooling in the lower extremities, and insufficient blood flow to the brain. Chronic fatigue. Brain gof. Headaches. Gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. Shortness of breath, or air hunger. Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns are common. Exercise intolerance. Sensitivity to light, sound, and smells.

* **Treatment**: Medications may include beta-blockers, fludrocortisone, and medications that affect blood vessel constriction. Lifestyle changes may include increasing fluid and salt intake to help maintain blood volume, wearing compression stockings to reduce blood pooling in the legs, and engaging in physical therapy to improve cardiovascular fitness.
