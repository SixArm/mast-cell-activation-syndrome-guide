# Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a form of dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. POTS primarily affects the cardiovascular system, causing an abnormal increase in heart rate when transitioning from lying down to standing up.

**Common symptoms**:

* **Excessive Heart Rate Increase**: One of the hallmark features of POTS is an abnormally high heart rate (tachycardia) when moving from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. The heart rate typically increases by at least 30 beats per minute or reaches 120 beats per minute or higher within 10 minutes of standing.

* **Orthostatic Intolerance**: Individuals with POTS often experience dizziness, lightheadedness, and sometimes fainting when they stand up. This is due to blood pooling in the lower extremities and insufficient blood flow to the brain.

* **Fatigue**: Chronic fatigue is a common symptom of POTS and can be debilitating.

* **Brain Fog**: Cognitive dysfunction, including difficulty concentrating and thinking.

* **Headaches**: Headaches can range from mild to severe.

* **Gastrointestinal Symptoms**: These can include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation.

* **Shortness of Breath**: Some people with POTS have difficulty breathing or may experience air hunger.

* **Sleep Disturbances**: Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns are common.

* **Exercise Intolerance**: Physical activity can exacerbate symptoms, and individuals with POTS often struggle with exercise or even daily tasks.

* **Sensory Sensitivities**: Some individuals with POTS may become more sensitive to light, sound, and smells.

* **Treatment**: Medications may include beta-blockers, fludrocortisone, and medications that affect blood vessel constriction. Lifestyle changes may include increasing fluid and salt intake to help maintain blood volume, wearing compression stockings to reduce blood pooling in the legs, and engaging in physical therapy to improve cardiovascular fitness.
