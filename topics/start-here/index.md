# Start here

If you're sick and you need help now, start here. If you're experiencing severe symptoms, or anaphylaxis, then seek emergency medical help.

**Ask a pharmacist**: Ask about over-the-counter treatments, and taking a morning H2 antihistamine (e.g. [famotidine](../famotidine/), brand name Pepcid), and an evening H1 antihistamine (e.g. [levocetirizine](../levocetirizine/), brand name Xyzal), and a rescue antihistamine (e.g. [diphenhydramine](../diphenhydramine/), brand name Benadryl). Ask about dye-free sugar-free color-free additive-free versions.

**Reduce triggers**: This means [household triggers](../household-triggers/), [chemical triggers](../chemical-triggers/), [environmental triggers](../environmental-triggers/), [food triggers](../food-triggers/), [water triggers](../water-triggers/), [car triggers](../car-triggers/), psychological triggers, hormone triggers, etc.  Remove [allergens, irritants, toxins](../allergens-irritants-toxins/). Use [air filters](../air-filters/) and [water filters](../water-filters/).

**Eat carefully**: Try an [elimination diet](../elimination-diet/), [low-histamine diet](../low-histamine-diet/), [low-allergen diet](../low-allergen-diet/). Start gluten-free, dairy-free, additive-free, hormone-free, spice-free. Very fresh or flash frozen. Discard skins and peels. No leftovers.

**Try supplements**: 20 minutes before meals: [diamine oxidase (DAO)](../diamine-oxidase/) and [quercetin](../quercetin/). During meals: [vitamin C (ascorbic acid)](../vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid/), [omega-3](../omega-3/), [n-acetyl cysteine (NAC)](../n-acetyl-cysteine/).

**Detoxify**: Each day take [glutathione](../glutathione/) at the start of 20 minutes of exercise. Each week do a 24-hour fast; in the middle of it, drink one teaspoon of [activated charcoal](../activated-charcoal/) dissolved in a glass of water (this may be hard on your digestion for 24-72 hours).

**Calm your body**: [stress management](../stress-management/), [self-soothing](../self-soothing/), [meditation](../meditation/), [polyvagal exercises](../polyvagal-exercises/), [limbic system retraining](../limbic-system-retraining/), [progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)](../progressive-muscle-relaxation], [sleep hygiene](../sleep-hygiene/).
