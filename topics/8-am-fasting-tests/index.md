# 8 a.m. fasting tests

8 a.m. fasting tests assess hormonal and metabolic functions, as hormone levels
can vary significantly throughout the day. Testing these levels in a fasting
state at 8 AM provides a baseline that helps diagnose and monitor endocrine
disorders.

Cortisol levels are measured to assess adrenal gland function and diagnose
conditions like Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease.

Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) tests help evaluate
pituitary function and diagnose growth disorders.

Aldosterone and renin tests are performed to investigate conditions like primary
aldosteronism, which affects blood pressure regulation.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are checked to understand adrenal
gland disorders, while prolactin measurements help diagnose prolactinomas and
other pituitary disorders.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is assessed for adrenal function and androgen
production.

Estrogen, luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), and progesterone tests are essential for evaluating reproductive health
and diagnosing conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and infertility.

Thyroid function is comprehensively assessed with tests for thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (free T3), free thyroxine (free T4), and
reverse T3. Thyroid antibodies, including Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin
(TSI) for Graves' disease, and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb) and
Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) for Hashimoto's disease, help diagnose
autoimmune thyroid conditions. Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) are also
measured to further investigate Graves' disease.
