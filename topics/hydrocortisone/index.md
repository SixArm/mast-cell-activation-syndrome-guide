# Hydrocortisone

Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid medication widely used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. It mimics the action of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, and is used to treat a variety of conditions, including allergic reactions, eczema, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone can be administered in several forms, including topical creams, oral tablets, and injections, depending on the condition being treated.

As an anti-inflammatory agent, hydrocortisone works by inhibiting the production of substances that cause inflammation, such as prostaglandins and cytokines. This action helps to alleviate symptoms like swelling, redness, itching, and pain. In autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, hydrocortisone helps to suppress overactive immune responses, providing relief from chronic symptoms and preventing further tissue damage.

While effective, hydrocortisone use can be associated with side effects, especially with long-term or high-dose use. Common side effects include skin thinning and irritation (when used topically), increased appetite, weight gain, and mood changes. More serious risks include osteoporosis, high blood pressure, and increased susceptibility to infections. Because of these potential side effects, hydrocortisone should be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider, with careful attention to dosage and duration of treatment.
