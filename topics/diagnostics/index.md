# Diagnostics

Diagnostics refers to the process of identifying the nature or cause of a particular phenomenon, often related to health or the functioning of a system.

**Examples**:

* **Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)**: Quick diagnostic tests performed at or near the point of patient care. Examples: rapid throat culture strep test, pregnancy urine stick test, 15-minute COVID swab test.

* **Medical Tests**: Common tests are blood tests, imaging studies (such as X-rays. CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds), and diagnostic procedures (such as biopsies or endoscopies).

* **Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics**: Analyze samples like blood, urine, and tissue to diagnose diseases, assess organ function, and monitor overall health.

* **Molecular Diagnostics such as DNA and RNA Testing**: Analyze genetic material to detect genetic disorders, identify pathogens (bacteria, viruses), and assess the risk of certain diseases.

* **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**: Used to amplify and detect DNA, particularly in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

* **Serological Tests**: Measure antibodies or antigens in blood to diagnose infections.
