# Sodium cromolyn timing

For people who are taking sodium cromolyn medication, timing matters. Generally follow the directions here: https://www.drugs.com/cons/cromolyn-oral.html

The purpose of sodium cromolyn timing is to continually provide sodium cromolyn to your mast cells, to stabilize them throughout the day.

Sodium cromolyn generally takes 1-4 weeks to ramp up. Start small.

Do not take sodium cromolyn together with anything else other than water. I.e. do not take sodium cromolyn at the same time as any other ingested medications or supplements, or foods or drinks other than water. This is because anything other than water will deactivate sodium cromolyn, according to manufacturers' directions.

Cromolyn sodium plasma half-life is about 80 minutes. For example, suppose your medication is working at full potency at 7:00 a.m.
80 minutes later is 1/2 potency. 80 minutes later is 1/4 potency. 80 minutes later is 1/8 potency. This rapid decrease is why many people plan to take sodium cromolyn multiple times per day.

Ideally people could take the 4 doses per day spread out every 6 hours, but that's not practical for most people because they want to sleep. Instead, most people aim for four doses per day, spread out during waking hours, at least 2 hours after food, and 20-30 minutes before meals.
