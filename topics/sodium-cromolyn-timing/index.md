# Sodium cromolyn timing

For people who are taking sodium cromolyn medication, timing matters. Generally follow the directions here: https://www.drugs.com/cons/cromolyn-oral.html

The purpose of sodium cromolyn timing is to continually provide sodium cromolyn to your mast cells, to stabilize them throughout the day.

Ideally people could take the 4 doses per day spread out every 6 hours, but that's not practical for most people because they want to sleep. Instead, most people aim for four doses per day, spread out during waking hours, at least 2 hours after food, and 20-30 minutes before meals, and before bedtime.

Sodium cromolyn generally takes 2-6 weeks to ramp up. Some people only see good gains after 2-4 months.

Oral dosing is from 100-200mg 2-4 times per day. A common brand uses a 5 mL ampule which contains 100 mg sodium cromolyn.

Nebulized dosing is from 10-20mg 2-4 times per day.


Start small. 

Example 1 is best for timing: start with a 1/4 dose 4 times per day for a week, then 1/2 dose 4 times per day for a week, then full dose 4 times per day ongoing. If you open an ampule, and only use some of dose, you cannot preserve the rest because it won't keep; you must dispose of the rest.

Example 2 is best for using all the medication: start with the full dose 1 time per day for a week, then 2 times per day for a week, then 4 times per day ongoing. This example is better if you have limited access to ampules or doses, and cannot waste any.

Many people experience symptoms when starting the medication that may last 3-4 days. Some people experience symptoms when increasing the dose.

Do not take sodium cromolyn together with anything else other than water. I.e. do not take sodium cromolyn at the same time as any other ingested medications or supplements, or foods or drinks other than water. This is because anything other than water will deactivate sodium cromolyn, according to manufacturers' directions.

Cromolyn sodium plasma half-life is about 80 minutes. For example, suppose your medication is working at full potency at 7:00 a.m. 80 minutes later is 1/2 potency. 80 minutes later is 1/4 potency. 80 minutes later is 1/8 potency. This rapid decrease is why many people plan to take sodium cromolyn multiple times per day.
