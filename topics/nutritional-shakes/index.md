# Nutritional shakes

Nutritional shakes, also known as meal replacement shakes, are beverages designed to provide a balanced and convenient source of essential nutrients. These shakes typically include a mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals to serve as a substitute for a regular meal.

**Key points:**

* **Nutrient Composition:** Nutrition shakes are formulated to provide a well-rounded mix of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). The goal is to offer a complete and balanced meal in liquid form.

* **Meal Replacement:** These shakes are often used as a convenient alternative to traditional meals, especially in situations where preparing or consuming a regular meal is challenging. They can be useful for individuals with busy lifestyles or those looking to manage their calorie intake.

* **Weight Management:** Some people use nutrition shakes as part of a weight management plan. They can be consumed for weight loss, weight maintenance, or even weight gain, depending on the formulation and individual goals.

* **Protein Sources:** Similar to protein shakes, nutrition shakes may contain various protein sources, such as whey, casein, soy, pea, or other plant-based proteins.

* **Flavors and Varieties:** Nutrition shakes come in a variety of flavors to suit different tastes. Some products also offer specific formulations for dietary preferences, such as vegan or gluten-free options.

* **Supplementation:** These shakes may contain added vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutritional supplements to enhance their nutritional profile.

* **Medical Purposes:** In certain situations, nutrition shakes may be recommended for medical reasons, such as for individuals who have difficulty chewing or swallowing solid food, or as part of a prescribed nutrition plan.
