# Nutritional shakes

Nutritional shakes, also known as meal replacement shakes, are beverages designed to provide a balanced and convenient source of essential nutrients. These shakes typically include a mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals to serve as a substitute for a regular meal.

**Key points:**

* **Nutrient Composition:** Nutrition shakes are formulated to provide a well-rounded mix of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).

* **Meal Replacement:** Shakes are often used as a convenient alternative to traditional meals, especially in situations where preparing or consuming a regular meal is challenging.

* **Weight Management:** Some people use nutrition shakes as part of a weight management plan. They can be consumed for weight loss, weight maintenance, or even weight gain, depending on the formulation and individual goals.

* **Protein Sources:** Similar to protein shakes, nutrition shakes may contain various protein sources, such as whey, casein, soy, pea, or other plant-based proteins.

* **Varieties:** Nutrition shakes come in a variety of flavors, and a variety of formulations for dietary preferences, such as gluten-free, or soy-free, or vegan.

* **Supplementation:** Shakes may contain added vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutritional supplements.

* **Medical Purposes:** Shakes may be recommended for medical reasons, such as for individuals who have difficulty chewing or swallowing solid food, or as part of a prescribed nutrition plan.
