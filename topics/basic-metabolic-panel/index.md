# Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)

A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) is a set of blood tests that provide essential information about your body's metabolism, particularly the status of your kidneys, blood glucose level, and electrolyte and acid/base balance. The BMP is a common diagnostic tool used in routine health check-ups and for monitoring patients with chronic conditions.

The BMP typically includes eight specific tests: glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide (bicarbonate), chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. Each of these tests measures different aspects of metabolic function:

* **Glucose**: This measures the level of sugar in the blood and is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes.

* **Calcium**: Vital for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling, abnormal calcium levels can indicate various health issues, including bone disease, kidney problems, or parathyroid gland disorders.

* **Sodium**: Essential for maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions, abnormal sodium levels can indicate dehydration, kidney disease, or other conditions.
* **Potassium**: Important for heart function and muscle contraction, abnormal potassium levels can affect the heart and other muscles.

* **Carbon dioxide (bicarbonate)**: This helps maintain the body's acid-base balance. Abnormal levels can indicate respiratory or metabolic issues.

* **Chloride**: Works with other electrolytes to maintain fluid balance and acid-base status. Abnormal chloride levels can be associated with dehydration, kidney disease, or other conditions.

* **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**: This measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea, a waste product of protein metabolism. It helps evaluate kidney function.

* **Creatinine**: A waste product from muscle metabolism, creatinine levels are also used to assess kidney function.
