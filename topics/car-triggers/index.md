# Car triggers

Cars can have many triggers. If you react when you're in a car, then consider this list. See [car triggers - diagnostics](../car-triggers-tests) then see [car triggers - treatment](../car-triggers-treatments/).

**Tangible triggers**:

* **Airborne triggers**: volatile organic chemicals from dashboard plastics, off-gas from car seat foam, air fresheners, mold, mildew, fungus, exhaust fumes, etc.

* **Contact triggers**: fabric treatments, leather guard, detailing cleaners, thermoset plastics, dust, dirt, mites, paper products, etc.

**Intangible triggers**:

* **Stress triggers**: emotional stress from going to work, anxiety from leaving the house, adrenaline increase from driving, fear of potential accidents, feeling startled, motion sickness, being with other people in the car, etc.

* **Energy triggers**: heat, electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as Bluetooth or WiFi, bright lights, loud sounds (even the car door closing), etc.

* **Vibration triggers**: engine rumbles, shocks from driving over rough roads, automatic stop-start banging, etc.
