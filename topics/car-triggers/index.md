# Car triggers

Cars can have many triggers. If you react when you're in a car, then consider this list.

**Examples**:

* **Tangible triggers**: Airborne triggers such as volatile organic chemicals from dashboard plastics, off-gas from car seat foam, air fresheners, mold, mildew, fungus, exhaust fumes. Contact triggers such as fabric treatments, leather guard, detailing cleaners, thermoset plastics, dust, dirt, mites.

* **Intangible triggers**: Stress triggers such as emotional stress from going to work, or anxiety from leaving the house, or adrenaline from driving. Energy triggers such as heat, electromagnetic fields (EMF)such as Bluetooth or WiFi, bright lights or moving lights, loud sounds, or vibrations.

**Diagnostics**:

* **Tangible trigger tests**: Sit in your car, engine off, wearing a mask that is a N99 or painter's respirator (not N95), plus full-body  clothes, gloves, goggles, and a hat. Don't touch anything. Does this make a difference? Try the same in other people's cars. Does any of this make a difference?

* **Intangible trigger tests**: Try the above protections, while driving safely. Try having someone else drive you. Try driving someone else's car. Try driving on a smooth road versus a bumpy road. Try turning off Bluetooth, WiFi, and any other electronics. Try driving on a leisurely weekend versus a hectic weekday. Does any of this make a difference?

**Treatments**:

* **Cleaning**: Have your car professionally cleaned with all hypoallergenic products. Do a mold test.

* **Filtering**: Add an air filters, such as one that plugs into your 12-volt outlet. Change your HVAC air filters.

* **Vibrations**: If everything else is ruled out other than vibrations, then ask a car mechanic for help. Consider better car shock absorbers, or disable the stop-start system, or check the engine mounts, or balance the tires and wheels, or tune up the engine, or get a better harmonic balancer, or even experiment with different cars such as going from gasoline to electric.
