# Moringa herbal infusion

[Source: Healing Histamine](https://www.healinghistamine.com/blog/5-best-histamine-intolerance-teas/)

Moringa has been shown to inhibit 72% of all histamines released, making it
almost as effective as the antihistamine eye medication, Ketotifen. Moringa is
also high in the bioflavonoid Kaempferol, which has been shown in studies to
prevent histamine release from mast cells.

Moringa often comes in the form of a powder from the ground leaves. It pairs
well with green tea, lemongrass, lemon zest, and coconut milk. You can even make
a Moringa latte.

**Ingredients**:

* 1 Tbsp Moringa tea powder
* 8-10 ounces dairy-free milk
* Sweetener to taste

**Instructions**:

* Heat milk on the stove using a small saucepan.
* Heat to just steaming without boiling.
* Remove from heat and add Moringa powder.
* Whisk or use a milk frother until combined.
* Sweeten to taste and enjoy.
