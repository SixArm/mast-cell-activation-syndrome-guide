# Oxaloacetic acid

Oxaloacetic acid, also known as oxaloacetate, is a crucial organic compound in biochemistry, essential for cellular respiration and energy production. With the chemical formula C4H4O5, it contains two carboxyl groups and a ketone group. In the Krebs cycle, which takes place in the mitochondria, oxaloacetic acid plays a vital role by combining with acetyl-CoA to form citrate. This process, catalyzed by the enzyme citrate synthase, initiates the cycle that ultimately regenerates oxaloacetic acid, enabling continuous ATP production.

Beyond the Krebs cycle, oxaloacetic acid is significant in gluconeogenesis, the metabolic pathway that synthesizes glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. It is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), eventually leading to glucose formation. This process is particularly important during fasting or intense physical activity when glucose levels need to be maintained.

Additionally, oxaloacetic acid serves as a precursor for the synthesis of several amino acids, including aspartate, which is further utilized to produce other amino acids and nucleotides. Its role in these metabolic pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and overall metabolic health.

Clinically, understanding oxaloacetic acid's functions can aid in diagnosing and treating metabolic disorders. There is ongoing research into the potential benefits of oxaloacetic acid supplements for enhancing energy metabolism. Its applications extend to agriculture, where it is used to boost crop growth and yield.
