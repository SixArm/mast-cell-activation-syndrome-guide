# Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)

Vitamin B2 (also known as riboflavin) play essentials roles in various metabolic processes in the body, for maintaining good health. Like other B-vitamins, riboflavin is water-soluble, meaning the body does not store it for long periods, so it needs to be regularly obtained from the diet.

Dietary sources of riboflavin include dairy products, lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and enriched cereals.

**Key points**:

* **Energy Metabolism**: Riboflavin is a coenzyme involved in energy metabolism. It works in conjunction with other enzymes to help convert carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's primary source of energy.

* **Cellular Growth and Repair**: Riboflavin is important for normal cell growth and function, including the repair and maintenance of various tissues.

* **Antioxidant Activity**: Riboflavin is part of the antioxidant system in the body. It helps protect cells from oxidative stress by participating in the regeneration of other antioxidants like glutathione.

* **Healthy Skin and Vision**: Adequate riboflavin intake is necessary for maintaining healthy skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. It also contributes to good vision.

* **Red Blood Cell Production**: Riboflavin plays a role in the formation of red blood cells.

* **Deficiency**: Riboflavin deficiency causes symptoms such as sore throat, cracked lips, and inflammation of the mouth and tongue. It can also result in a condition called ariboflavinosis.
