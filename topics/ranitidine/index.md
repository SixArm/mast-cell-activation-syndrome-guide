# Ranitidine

Ranitidine is a medication commonly used to reduce the production of stomach acid. It belongs to a class of drugs called H2 blockers. Ranitidine works by blocking the action of histamine on the stomach cells, which reduces the production of acid. Brand name: rand name Zantac.

It is primarily prescribed to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Ranitidine can help relieve symptoms such as heartburn, acid indigestion, and stomach pain caused by excess stomach acid.

Ranitidine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and by prescription in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and oral syrup. It can also be administered intravenously in hospital settings for more severe conditions.

In September 2019, concerns were raised about the presence of a potential carcinogen called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in ranitidine products. As a result, many regulatory agencies worldwide issued recalls, and the drug was withdrawn from the market in several countries. Patients who were taking ranitidine were advised to consult their healthcare providers for alternative treatments.

It's essential to always follow your doctor's instructions and to discuss any concerns or potential side effects associated with ranitidine or any other medication.
