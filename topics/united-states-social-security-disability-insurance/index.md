# United States Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)

United States Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a federal program designed to provide financial assistance to individuals who are unable to work due to a severe, long-term disability. Funded by payroll taxes, SSDI is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and aims to support those who have contributed to the Social Security system through their employment.

To qualify for SSDI, applicants must have a medical condition that meets the SSA's definition of disability, which is a physical or mental impairment that is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, and prevents them from performing substantial gainful activity (SGA). Additionally, applicants must have earned enough work credits, which are accumulated through taxable work. Generally, younger workers need fewer credits than older workers to qualify.

The application process for SSDI can be complex and lengthy, often requiring detailed medical documentation and sometimes multiple reviews or appeals. Applicants must provide comprehensive evidence of their condition, including medical records, treatment history, and statements from healthcare providers.

Once approved, SSDI beneficiaries receive monthly payments based on their average lifetime earnings prior to their disability. These benefits can provide critical financial support for daily living expenses and medical needs. Beneficiaries may also be eligible for Medicare after a 24-month waiting period.

SSDI offers financial relief and also access to various vocational rehabilitation and employment support services. These services aim to help beneficiaries return to work if they are able, ensuring a holistic approach to supporting disabled individuals. Overall, SSDI plays a crucial role in the social safety net, offering vital support to those who can no longer earn a living due to disability.
