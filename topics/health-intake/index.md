# Health intake

Health intake describes when a healthcare patient comes to a healthcare provider for the first time, and the patient and provider gather information about the patient's health status, symptoms, history, and goals.

**Key aspects**:

* **Physical examination**: Assess all the body systems, such as the circulatory system (e.g. measure blood pressure and heart rate), reflex system (e.g. tap on the knee), airways system (e.g. take a deep breath), and so forth.

* **History**: Significant illnesses, injuries, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, surgeries, hospitalizations, and other medical events.
May include broader aspects such as nutrition history, lifestyle history, occupational history, psychosocial history, family history.

* **Diagnostics**: Common diagnostic tests for new patient intake may include a complete blood count (CBC), 24-hour urine test, and more.
 
* **Goals**: Goals are the patient's desired improvements. Ideally create goals that are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely.
