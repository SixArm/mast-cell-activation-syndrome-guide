# Lymph

Lymph is a colorless fluid that circulates in the body, to maintain tissue health and support the immune system. Lymph is produced as an extracellular fluid, known as interstitial fluid, that bathes the cells and tissues of the body. Lymph is collected and transported through a network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes.

When the body fights an infection or deals with inflammation, the lymphatic system can become more active, resulting in symptoms like swollen lymph nodes and increased production of lymphocytes to combat the infection.

**Key aspects:**

* **Fluid Balance:** Lymph helps regulate the balance of fluids in the body by collecting excess fluid, proteins, and waste products that have leaked from blood vessels and surrounding tissues. This excess fluid is returned to the bloodstream.

* **Immune Function:** Lymph contains white blood cells, primarily lymphocytes. Lymphocytes play a key role in identifying and fighting off infections and diseases.

* **Transport:** Lymphatic vessels, or lymphatics, are a network of thin-walled tubes that transport lymph throughout the body. These vessels are similar to blood vessels but do not have a pump like the heart. Instead, lymph is moved through the lymphatic vessels by muscular contractions, body movements, and pressure changes.

* **Lymph nodes:** Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures found throughout the lymphatic system. They filter and cleanse the lymph by trapping and destroying foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses. Enlarged or tender lymph nodes are often a sign of an infection or other medical condition.

* **Lymphatic Organs:** lymphatic organs like the spleen and the thymus play a role in immune function and the production of lymphocytes.
