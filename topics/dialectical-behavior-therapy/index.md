# Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT). Dialectics refers to the acceptance of conflicting thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors as valid and the synthesis of these opposing elements to promote
change and growth.

DBT typically involves individual therapy sessions, group skills training
sessions, phone coaching between sessions, and consultation team meetings for
therapists.

**Key aspects**:

* **Emotion regulation**: Learning to identify, understand, and manage intense
  emotions in healthy and adaptive ways. This includes skills for tolerating
  distress, reducing emotional vulnerability, and increasing emotional
  resilience.

* **Interpersonal effectiveness**: Improving communication and relationship
  skills to navigate interpersonal conflicts, set boundaries, and assertively
  express needs and desires while maintaining self-respect and respect for
  others.

* **Distress tolerance**: Developing strategies for coping with distressing
  situations without resorting to harmful or impulsive behaviors. This includes
  learning to tolerate distressing emotions and situations without avoiding or
  reacting impulsively.

* **Mindfulness**: Cultivating present-moment awareness and non-judgmental
  acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Mindfulness skills are
  central to DBT and are used to enhance self-awareness, reduce reactivity, and
  promote psychological well-being.

* **Practice**: The comprehensive nature of DBT allows individuals to learn and
  practice skills in various contexts and receive support from their therapist
  and peers throughout the process.
