# Digital motion x-ray (DMX)

Digital motion x-ray (DMX) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess dynamic movement of the spine and joints in real-time. Unlike traditional X-rays, which capture static images of bones and tissues, DMX provides continuous, dynamic imaging as the patient moves.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: DMX is primarily used to evaluate the movement and stability of the spine and joints, particularly in cases of suspected ligamentous instability, spinal injuries, or chronic pain conditions that worsen with movement.

* **Indications**: Whiplash injuries, ligamentous injuries, spinal instability, spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, or facet joint dysfunction, chronic spine pain.

* **Advantages**: Real-time imaging, functional assessment, and objective evidence of abnormal motion patterns.
