# Mold exposure diagnostics

Mold exposure diagnostics involve a combination of clinical assessment, medical history, and various diagnostic tests to determine if an individual has been exposed to mold and if the exposure is contributing to health issues.

**Common approaches**:

* **Environmental History**: Gathering information about the individual's living and working environments is essential. Questions may be asked about the presence of water damage, visible mold, or other conditions that could contribute to mold growth.

* **Mold Testing**: This may involve air sampling, surface sampling, or bulk sampling to identify the presence and types of molds.

* **Serum IgE Testing**: Blood tests may be performed to measure specific antibodies, such as immunoglobulin E (IgE), that the body produces in response to mold allergens.

* **Skin Prick Testing**: Skin prick testing involves applying small amounts of mold extracts to the skin and observing for allergic reactions.

* **Imaging Studies**: In some cases, imaging studies such as chest X-rays or CT scans may be performed to assess respiratory symptoms and identify any potential lung issues.

* **Clinical Laboratory Tests**: Blood tests or other laboratory tests may be ordered to assess general health, including markers of inflammation or immune system function.
