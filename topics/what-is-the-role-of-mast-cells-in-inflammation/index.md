In this video we'll talk about mast cells, which are involved in the allergic response…

Mast cells reside underneath the connective tissue. They contain granules which are enriched in histamine and heparin, which are important modulators in immunity…

They can be found in many epithelial layers. They can be found in connective tissues. They are found in genital urinary tract and respiratory epithelium…

Mature mast cells are highly associated with allergic responses. Mast cells hav specific receptors known as FC receptors. These can bind to IgE antibodies, so whenever there is an allergen-mediated exposure, mast cells get sensitized and they degranulate. In these granules there are several allergic mediators, so there are many physiological outcomes, like bronchoconstriction, increased glandular secretion, smooth muscle constriction, and vasodilation.
