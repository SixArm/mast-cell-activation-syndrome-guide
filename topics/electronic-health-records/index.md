# Electronic health records (EHR)

Electronic health records (EHR) are digital versions of patients' paper charts and medical histories, designed to streamline and enhance the management of healthcare information. EHRs contain comprehensive data on patients, including their medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. This information is securely stored and can be accessed by authorized healthcare providers across different medical settings.

The adoption of EHRs has revolutionized healthcare by improving the efficiency and quality of care. EHRs facilitate real-time access to patient information, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed decisions quickly. This immediate availability of data reduces the likelihood of medical errors, as clinicians can easily track patients' medical histories and avoid redundant tests or conflicting treatments.

EHRs also enhance coordination among healthcare providers. When a patient visits multiple specialists, EHRs ensure that all providers have access to the same updated information, fostering better collaboration and continuity of care. This integrated approach is particularly beneficial for managing chronic diseases and complex medical conditions, where coordinated care is crucial.

Moreover, EHRs support patient engagement by providing patients with access to their own health information through patient portals. These portals allow patients to view their medical records, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, and communicate with their healthcare providers, promoting active participation in their own care.
