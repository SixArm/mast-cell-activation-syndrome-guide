# Food diary

A food diary, also known as a food journal or food log, is a record of the foods and beverages you consume throughout the day. It's a valuable tool for tracking your dietary habits, calorie intake, and nutritional choices.

You can keep a food diary using a physical notebook or by using a food tracking app or website. Many apps make it easy to enter and analyze your dietary information, and some even provide nutritional information for the foods you eat.

Key aspectsâ€¦

* **Record Everything You Eat and Drink**: Write down every item you consume, including meals, snacks, and beverages. Be as specific as possible, noting portion sizes, cooking methods, brand names, time, triggers such as stress or boredom, and any patterns.

* **Record Ingredients**: For homemade dishes and recipes, list the ingredients and their quantities. This is particularly important if you have specific dietary restrictions or allergies.

* **Add Notes**: Include any relevant notes about your meals, such as how you felt while eating (e.g., hungry, stressed, bored) and any digestive or physical reactions afterward.

* **Review and Analyze**: After maintaining the food diary for your chosen duration, review and analyze your entries. Look for patterns, such as overeating at certain times or consuming too much of a particular type of food. Use this information to make informed decisions about your diet and identify areas for improvement.
