# Food diary

A food diary, also known as a food journal or food log, is a record of the foods and beverages you consume throughout the day. It's a valuable tool for tracking your dietary habits, calorie intake, and nutritional choices.

Keeping a food diary can provide insights into your eating patterns, help you make more informed food choices, and assist with health and wellness goals.

Key stepsâ€¦

Record Everything You Eat and Drink: Write down every item you consume, including meals, snacks, and beverages. Be as specific as possible, noting portion sizes, cooking methods, and brand names.

Note the Time: Record the time you eat each meal or snack. This can help identify patterns in your eating habits, such as whether you tend to eat at certain times of day or in response to specific triggers (e.g., stress, boredom).

Be Honest and Accurate: To get the most benefit from your food diary, be honest and accurate in your entries. Don't skip or omit items, even if they are less healthy choices. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of your eating habits.

Include Serving Sizes: Specify the serving sizes or portion sizes you consume. You can use measuring cups, a food scale, or references like "a deck of cards" or "a tennis ball" to estimate portion sizes.

Record Ingredients: For homemade dishes and recipes, list the ingredients and their quantities. This is particularly important if you have specific dietary restrictions or allergies.

Track Snacking and Drinks: Don't forget to log snacks, beverages (including water), and any condiments or sauces you use.

Add Notes: Include any relevant notes about your meals, such as how you felt while eating (e.g., hungry, stressed, bored) and any digestive or physical reactions afterward.

Duration: Decide how long you want to maintain the food diary. You might choose to keep it for a few days, a week, or longer, depending on your goals.

Use a Physical Notebook or App: You can keep a food diary using a physical notebook or by using a food tracking app or website. Many apps make it easy to enter and analyze your dietary information, and some even provide nutritional information for the foods you eat.

Review and Analyze: After maintaining the food diary for your chosen duration, review and analyze your entries. Look for patterns, such as overeating at certain times or consuming too much of a particular type of food. Use this information to make informed decisions about your diet and identify areas for improvement.
