# Allergies

Allergies are exaggerated or hypersensitive immune responses to substances that are typically harmless to most people. These substances, known as allergens, can trigger an immune reaction in individuals who are allergic to them. Individuals with allergies can work with healthcare professionals to manage their condition effectively, understand their triggers, and have a plan in place to address allergic reactions when they occur.

Key pointsâ€¦

* Common Allergens: Pollen, dust mites, animal dander, insect stings, certain foods (e.g., peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, shellfish), medications (e.g., antibiotics, aspirin), latex, and more.

* Common Symptoms: Sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, skin rashes, hives, swelling, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

* Anaphylaxis: It can involve symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, a drop in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness. Anaphylaxis can be fatal.

* Immune Response: When an allergic person is exposed to an allergen, their immune system recognizes it as a threat and produces antibodies, such as IgE (immunoglobulin E), specific to that allergen.

* Diagnosis: Allergies are often diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and specific tests, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, which can help identify allergens triggering the symptoms.

* Treatment: The primary treatment for allergies involves avoiding the allergen whenever possible. Medications can also be used to relieve allergy symptoms. These may include antihistamines, decongestants, corticosteroids, and epinephrine for severe reactions. For some allergies, allergen-specific immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets) may be recommended.
