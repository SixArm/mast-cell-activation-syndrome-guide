# Vitamin B3 = Niacin

Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or nicotinic acid, is one of the water-soluble B-vitamins that plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes within the body. Niacin is involved in several important functions, including energy production, DNA repair, and the maintenance of healthy skin and nervous system. Here are some key aspects of vitamin B3 (niacin):

* **Energy Metabolism**: Niacin is a key component of the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are involved in a wide range of metabolic reactions. These coenzymes play a vital role in converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy.

* **DNA Repair**: Niacin is important for DNA repair and synthesis, which is essential for the proper functioning and replication of cells.

* **Skin Health**: Adequate niacin intake is necessary for maintaining healthy skin. It can help improve skin conditions like acne and reduce the risk of certain skin disorders.

* **Cardiovascular Health**: Niacin is sometimes used to manage cholesterol levels. It can raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (often called "good" cholesterol) and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (often called "bad" cholesterol).

* **Nervous System Function**: Niacin is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Deficiency can lead to a condition known as pellagra, which is characterized by neurological symptoms.

Dietary sources of niacin include meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, eggs, nuts, and legumes. It can also be synthesized in the body from the amino acid tryptophan, although this process may not provide sufficient niacin if dietary sources are inadequate.

Severe niacin deficiency can lead to pellagra, which presents with symptoms like diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. However, pellagra is rare in well-balanced diets. To prevent deficiency, it's important to consume foods rich in niacin as part of a healthy diet. In some cases, niacin supplements may be recommended to treat specific health conditions, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
