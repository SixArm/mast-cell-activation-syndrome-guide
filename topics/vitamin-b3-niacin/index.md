# Vitamin B3 (niacin)

Vitamin B3 (also known as niacin or nicotinic acid) is one of the water-soluble B-vitamins. Niacin is involved in several important functions, including energy production, DNA repair, and the maintenance of healthy skin and nervous system.

**Key points:**

* **Energy Metabolism**: Niacin is a key component of the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These coenzymes play a vital role in converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy.

* **DNA Repair**: Niacin is important for DNA repair and synthesis, which is essential for the proper functioning and replication of cells.

* **Skin Health**: Adequate niacin intake is necessary for maintaining healthy skin. It can help improve skin conditions like acne and reduce the risk of certain skin disorders.

* **Cardiovascular Health**: Niacin can raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (often called "good" cholesterol) and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (often called "bad" cholesterol).

* **Nervous System Function**: Niacin is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Deficiency can lead to a condition known as pellagra, which is characterized by neurological symptoms.

* **Deficiency**: Severe niacin deficiency can lead to pellagra, which presents with symptoms like diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia.

Dietary sources include meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, eggs, nuts, and legumes.
