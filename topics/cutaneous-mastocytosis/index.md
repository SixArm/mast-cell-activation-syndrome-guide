# Cutaneous mastocytosis

Cutaneous mastocytosis primarily affects the skin and is more common in children.

Cutaneous mastocytosis includes conditions such as:

* Urticaria Pigmentosa: This is the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis and typically appears as reddish-brown patches or small raised bumps on the skin.

* Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis: This form is more extensive and covers larger areas of the skin.

* Telangiectasia Macularis Eruptiva Perstans (TMEP): This is characterized by reddish-brown macules or small bumps, often with telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) on the skin.
