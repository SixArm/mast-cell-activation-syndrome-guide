# Compounding pharmacy

A compounding pharmacy is a specialized type of pharmacy that is involved in the preparation of customized medications to meet the unique needs of individual patients. Compounding pharmacies have the ability to combine, mix, or alter ingredients to create medications that are not readily available in commercially manufactured forms. This allows them to tailor medications to specific dosage strengths, forms, and formulations based on a healthcare provider's prescription and a patient's specific requirements.

**Key points**:

* **Customized Medications**: Compounding pharmacies can prepare medications in various forms, including capsules, creams, gels, liquids, or other specialized formulations.

* **Individualized Dosing**: Medications can be compounded in specific dosage strengths to meet the precise needs of a patient, especially when commercial forms are not suitable.

* **Flavoring and Allergen-Free Options**: Compounded medications can be flavored to improve taste, which is particularly useful for pediatric patients. They can also be prepared without certain allergens or additives.

* **Unavailable or Discontinued Medications**: Compounding pharmacies can recreate medications that may be temporarily unavailable or discontinued by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

* **Bio-identical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT)**: Compounding pharmacies are often involved in the preparation of bio-identical hormones for hormone replacement therapy, customized to an individual's hormone needs.

* **Veterinary Compounding**: Compounding pharmacies also provide services for preparing medications for animals, tailoring dosages and formulations to meet the specific needs of pets or other animals.
