# Shower triggers

Shower triggers come in four major types:

1. Water triggers: some people react to household tap water, because it contains elements and minerals and chemicals.

2. Sensation triggers: some people react to the sensation of a shower, especially if the water impact causes body vibrations.

3. Postural triggers: some people react to standing up in a shower, especially if the person also has [Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)](../postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome/).

4. Temperature triggers: some people react to temperature changes, either hot or cold, especially because the water can cause skin symptoms and the air can cause breathing symptoms.

To figure out what's happening:

1. Try washing with distilled water. This helps discover tap water triggers.

2. Try taking a bath. This helps discover sensation impact/vibration triggers.

3. Try taking a shower while sitting. This helps discover postural triggers.

4. Try taking a shower with a mild temperature. This helps discover heat/cold triggers.
