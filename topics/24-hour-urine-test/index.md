# 24-hour urine test

A 24-hour urine test is a diagnostic procedure used to measure various substances excreted in urine over a 24-hour period. It can provide valuable information about kidney function, electrolyte balance, and other aspects of health.

**Steps**:

* **Collection**: The patient collects all urine produced over a 24-hour period. Usually, the process starts with an empty bladder, and all urine thereafter is collected, including the first morning urine the next day.

* **Storage**: Urine is stored in a container provided by the healthcare provider. It's important to keep the container in a cool place, like a refrigerator, to prevent bacterial growth and preserve the integrity of the sample.

* **Avoiding Contamination**: During the collection period, it's essential to avoid contaminating the sample with stool, toilet paper, or other foreign substances. The healthcare provider will provide instructions on how to collect and handle the sample properly.

* **Return the Sample**: Once the collection period is complete, the patient returns the sample to the healthcare provider or lab for analysis.

* **Analysis**: The laboratory analyzes the urine sample to measure various substances such as creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), protein, hormones, and other markers.
  
* **Interpretation**: Results are interpreted by healthcare providers in the context of the patient's medical history and symptoms. Abnormal levels of certain substances may indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other health issues.

**Tests may include**:

* N-methyl histamine

* 2,3-Dinor-11beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha level

* Leukotriene E4 level
