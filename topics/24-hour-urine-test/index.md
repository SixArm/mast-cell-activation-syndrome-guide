# 24-hour urine test

A 24-hour urine test is a diagnostic procedure used to measure various substances excreted in urine over a 24-hour period. It can provide valuable information about kidney function, electrolyte balance, and other aspects of health.

**Key points**:

* **Steps**: The patient collects all urine produced over a 24-hour period. Usually, the process starts with an empty bladder, and all urine thereafter is collected, including the first morning urine the next day. Urine is stored in a container provided by the healthcare provider, and kept in a refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth.

* **Analysis**: The laboratory analyzes the urine sample to measure various substances such as creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), protein, hormones, and other markers.
  
* **Interpretation**: Results are interpreted by healthcare providers in the context of the patient's [medical history](../medical-history/\) and symptoms. Abnormal levels of certain substances may indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other health issues.

**Tests may include**:

* N-methyl histamine

* 2,3-Dinor-11beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha level

* Leukotriene E4 level
