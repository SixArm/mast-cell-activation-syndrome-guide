# Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) diet

The Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) diet is a therapeutic dietary protocol developed by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, a neurologist and nutritionist. The diet is designed to address conditions related to gut health and is often used to support individuals with digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, and certain psychological conditions such asa anxiety and depression.

**Key principles**:

* **Gut Health Focus**: The diet emphasizes the connection between the gut health and overall well-being, because a compromised gut lining can contribute to health problems.

* **Removal of Certain Foods**: The initial stages of the GAPS diet involve the elimination of certain foods that are believed to contribute to gut issues. This includes processed foods, grains, sugars, and starchy vegetables.

* **Introduction of Gut-Healing Foods**: The diet promotes the consumption of nutrient-dense, easily digestible foods that are believed to support gut healing. This includes bone broth, fermented foods (such as sauerkraut and yogurt), and specific animal proteins.

* **Phases of the Diet**: The GAPS diet is implemented in stages, starting with an introductory phase that limits foods to easily digestible and gut-healing options. As individuals progress, they can gradually reintroduce more diverse foods.

* **Probiotics and Supplements**: Probiotic-rich foods and supplements are encouraged to support the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Fish oil and other supplements may also be recommended.
