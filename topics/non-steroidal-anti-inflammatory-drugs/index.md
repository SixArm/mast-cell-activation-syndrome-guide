# Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a widely used class of medications that alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. Commonly recognized NSAIDs include [ibuprofen](../ibuprofin/), naproxen, and aspirin. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which play a key role in the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are lipid compounds that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever, so by blocking their synthesis, NSAIDs effectively manage these symptoms.

NSAIDs are utilized to treat a variety of conditions, including arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, and minor injuries. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription forms, allowing for broad accessibility and use in managing both acute and chronic pain. Despite their benefits, NSAIDs are associated with several potential side effects. Gastrointestinal issues, such as stomach ulcers and bleeding, are common with prolonged use due to the inhibition of COX-1, which protects the stomach lining. Additionally, NSAIDs can increase the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes, especially in individuals with preexisting heart conditions.

Long-term use of NSAIDs can also affect kidney function, leading to potential renal impairment. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to use these medications under medical supervision, particularly if they have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. Balancing the therapeutic benefits of NSAIDs with their risks requires careful consideration and often involves tailoring the treatment to the individualâ€™s specific health needs.
