# Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of medications commonly used to alleviate pain, inflammation, and fever. They work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, to reduce the production of prostaglandins, resulting in decreased inflammation and pain relief.

Some common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac.

NSAIDs are used to manage a wide range of conditions, including pain relief for headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, and dental pain. They are also effective in reducing inflammation associated with conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, and other musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, NSAIDs can help lower fever by reducing the production of prostaglandins involved in the body's temperature regulation.

Despite their effectiveness, NSAIDs can cause side effects, particularly with long-term or high-dose use. Common side effects include gastrointestinal irritation, ulcers, and bleeding, as well as cardiovascular effects such as an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. NSAIDs can also impair kidney function and cause allergic reactions in some individuals.

Precautions should be taken when using NSAIDs, especially in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding, kidney disease, heart disease, or allergic reactions to NSAIDs. It's important to use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary to relieve symptoms.
