# Hypotension causes

Hypotension (low blood pressure) has various potential causes and types, including:

* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** This occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly when a person moves from a sitting or lying position to a standing position. Common causes include dehydration, medication side effects, and autonomic nervous system disorders.

* **Neurally Mediated Hypotension (NMH):** This type of hypotension is often associated with fainting (syncope) and can result from an abnormal reflex response that causes blood pressure to drop during certain activities or situations.

* **Postprandial Hypotension:** A drop in blood pressure after eating, which can affect some people, especially the elderly.

* **Severe Infections:** Serious infections can lead to septic shock, a condition characterized by dangerously low blood pressure.

* **Hypotension Due to Heart Problems:** Certain heart conditions, such as heart failure or bradycardia (slow heart rate), can result in low blood pressure.

* **Medications:** Some medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, may inadvertently cause low blood pressure as a side effect.

* **Dehydration:** A loss of fluids from the body can result in low blood pressure.

* **Anaphylaxis:** A severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure.
