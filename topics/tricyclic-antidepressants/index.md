# Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of medications primarily used to treat depression. They are called "tricyclic" because their chemical structure contains three rings of atoms. TCAs may also be used to treat other conditions, including: anxiety disorders, chronic pain conditions, migraines, and certain sleep disorders such as insomnia.

**Key points**:

* **Action**: TCAs work by inhibiting the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine, in the brain. By increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic space between neurons, TCAs help to improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression.

* **Examples**: Some common tricyclic antidepressants include: Amitriptyline (Elavil), Imipramine (Tofranil), Nortriptyline (Pamelor), Desipramine (Norpramin),  Doxepin (Sinequan), Clomipramine (Anafranil).

* **Risks**: Common side effects: dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects: cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure upon standing), and anticholinergic effects (e.g., confusion, memory impairment).
