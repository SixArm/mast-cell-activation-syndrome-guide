# Buteyko breathing method

The Buteyko Breathing Method is a set of breathing techniques designed to address various health issues, particularly those related to breathing difficulties and respiratory conditions, by teaching individuals how to modify their breathing patterns.

**Key points**:

* **Shallow Breathing**: The method emphasizes the importance of breathing gently and shallowly through the nose. It encourages a reduced rate and volume of breathing to maintain healthy carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body.

* **Nasal Breathing**: Breathing through the nose is a fundamental aspect of the Buteyko method. The nose helps filter, humidify, and warm the incoming air, as well as play a role in producing nitric oxide, which has various health benefits.

* **Breath Holding**: Practitioners are taught to practice breath holding, or breath suspension, as part of the exercises. This helps to increase CO2 levels and improve overall respiratory function.

* **Reduced Breathing**: The method involves slowing down and reducing the frequency of breaths to encourage a more efficient exchange of gases in the lungs, leading to better oxygenation and CO2 balance.

* **Assessment**: Individuals are often assessed to determine their initial breathing patterns and to monitor their progress over time. Practitioners may use a "Control Pause" test to measure breath-holding time as an indicator of CO2 tolerance.

* **Conditions Treated**: The Buteyko Breathing Method is primarily used to address various respiratory conditions, including asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sleep apnea. It is also used for conditions related to stress and anxiety.
