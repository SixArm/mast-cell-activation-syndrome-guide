# Macronutrients and micronutrients

Macronutrients and micronutrients are two categories of essential nutrients that the body requires to function properly.
Macronutrients are required by the body in relatively large amounts, to provide the energy necessary for bodily functions, growth, development, and maintenance. Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in relatively small amounts, to support physiological processes.

**Macronutrient types:**

* **Carbohydrates**: Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. They are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for fuel. Sources: grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, sugars.

* **Proteins**: Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues. They are made up of amino acids, which play a role in various bodily functions. Sources: meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds.

* **Fats**: Fats are a concentrated source of energy and are important for hormone production, cell structure, and nutrient absorption. Sources: oils, butter, avocados, nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and certain dairy products.

**Micronutrient types**:

* **Vitamins**: Vitamins are organic compounds that support various physiological processes. They are crucial for metabolism, immune function, and other biochemical reactions. Examples: [vitamin A (retinol)](../vitamin-a/), [vitamin B-complex](../vitamin-b-complex/), and [Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)](../vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid/).

* **Minerals**: Minerals are inorganic elements that play roles in bone health, nerve function, fluid balance, and other physiological processes. Examples: [calcium](../calcium/), [iodine](../iodine), [potassium](../potassium/), [sodium](../sodium/), [magnesium](../magnesium/), [iron](../iron/), and [zinc](../zinc/)
