# Potassium supplements

Potassium supplements are dietary supplements that contain potassium, an essential mineral that plays a vital role in various physiological functions in the body. Potassium is an electrolyte, which means it helps conduct electrical impulses in the body and is essential for maintaining proper fluid balance, nerve function, muscle contractions, and heart rhythm. 

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: Potassium supplements are commonly used to prevent or treat potassium deficiency, a condition characterized by low levels of potassium in the body. Potassium deficiency can occur due to inadequate dietary intake, excessive loss of potassium (e.g., through vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating), certain medical conditions (such as kidney disease or gastrointestinal disorders), or medications (such as diuretics).

* **Forms**: Potassium supplements come in various forms, including potassium chloride, potassium citrate, potassium gluconate, and potassium bicarbonate. 

* **Dosage**: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for potassium is around 4,700 milligrams (mg) per day for adults.

* **Indications**: Potassium supplements are indicated for individuals with diagnosed potassium deficiency or those at risk of developing potassium deficiency due to factors such as inadequate dietary intake, excessive potassium loss, or certain medical conditions that affect potassium balance. Potassium supplements may also be prescribed to individuals taking medications that can deplete potassium levels, such as diuretics.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects of potassium supplements may include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach upset.

* **Safety**: WExcessive potassium intake can lead to toxicity and adverse health effects, particularly in individuals with impaired kidney function or certain medical conditions (such as hyperkalemia).
