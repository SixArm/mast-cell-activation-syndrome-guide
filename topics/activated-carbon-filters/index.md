# Activated carbon filters

Activated carbon filters, also known as [activated charcoal](../activated-charcoal/) filters, are specialized air and water purification filters that use activated carbon to remove certain impurities from the air or water.

**Key points:**

* **Adsorption mechanism**: Activated carbon is a porous form of carbon that has undergone a process of activation, which increases its surface area and makes it highly effective for adsorption. Adsorption involves the adherence of molecules to the surface of the activated carbon, trapping them. The porous structure of activated carbon provides a large surface area, allowing it to capture a variety of impurities.

* **Air filtration**: Activated carbon filters excel in removing gases, odors, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the air. This makes them effective in addressing indoor air quality concerns related to cooking odors, pet odors, and pollutants emitted from household products. Activated carbon filters are commonly used in air purifiers and HVAC systems.

* **Water filtration**: Activated carbon filters can remove certain chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, benzene, and pesticides. They are employed in both point-of-use (e.g., water pitchers) and point-of-entry (e.g., whole-house water filtration systems) applications.

* **Maintenance**: Activated carbon filters have a limited lifespan. Over time, the adsorption capacity diminishes as the pores become filled with impurities. Regular replacement or regeneration is necessary.
