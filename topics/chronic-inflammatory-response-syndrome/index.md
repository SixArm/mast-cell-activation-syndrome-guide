# Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS)

Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a medical condition characterized by a persistent and excessive inflammatory response in the body.

**Key points:**

* **Triggers**: CIRS is often triggered by exposure to biotoxins, such as mycotoxins produced by molds. Other triggers may include Lyme disease and exposure to certain algae and bacteria.

* **Symptoms**: May include fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), difficulty concentrating, memory problems, headaches, joint pain, respiratory issues, gastrointestinal problems, and sensitivity to light and sound.

* **Hormone Disruption**: CIRS can affect the endocrine system, leading to hormonal imbalances. This may result in issues such as adrenal fatigue and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

* **Genetic Predisposition**: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to CIRS. Specific genetic markers, such as HLA-DR, may play a role in determining susceptibility.

* **Treatment**: Treatment of CIRS typically involves addressing the underlying environmental exposures, such as mold remediation. Additionally, a comprehensive approach may include supportive therapies, detoxification strategies, and medications to modulate the immune response.
