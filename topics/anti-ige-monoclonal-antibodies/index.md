# Anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies

TODO

Anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies are a class of biologic medications designed to treat allergic conditions and asthma by targeting and neutralizing immunoglobulin E (IgE), a key antibody involved in allergic responses. These medications work by binding to free IgE in the bloodstream, preventing it from attaching to receptors on mast cells and basophils, which are responsible for releasing histamines and other chemicals that cause allergic symptoms.

One of the most well-known anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies is omalizumab, marketed under the brand name Xolair. Omalizumab is primarily used to treat moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well-controlled with standard inhaled corticosteroids. It is also approved for chronic spontaneous urticaria (hives) in patients who do not respond adequately to antihistamines. By reducing IgE levels, omalizumab helps decrease the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations and allergic reactions.

The administration of anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies typically involves subcutaneous injections given every two to four weeks. The dosage is determined based on the patientâ€™s body weight and baseline IgE levels. While these medications are generally well-tolerated, potential side effects can include injection site reactions, headaches, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis.

Anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies represent a significant advancement in the management of allergic diseases and asthma. By specifically targeting IgE, they offer a more precise approach to treatment, improving symptoms and quality of life for patients with severe allergic conditions. Ongoing research continues to explore their potential in treating other IgE-mediated disorders, potentially expanding their therapeutic applications in the future.
