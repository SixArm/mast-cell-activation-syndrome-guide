# Self-soothing

Self-soothing refers to the ability to comfort and calm oneself in times of stress, discomfort, or emotional distress. It can contribute to emotional regulation and overall well-being.

**Some techniques**:

* **Deep Breathing**: Inhale deeply through your nose. Hold for a few seconds. Exhale slowly through your mouth.

* **Mindfulness Meditation**: Bring awareness to the present moment. Focus on your breath, or your sensations, or your environment.

* **Positive Affirmations**: Repeat positive affirmations or self-comforting statements.
