# Transient receptor potential (TRP) disorders versus mast cell disorders

Transient receptor potential (TRP) disorders involve cell molecular channels. TRP disorders are complex and are somewhat like mast cell disorders because both kinds of disorders can cause many kinds of effects in many body systems, and also because there are variants that affect some systems (like lungs) more than others (like gut).

TRP disorders associate with gut issues such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), skin issues such as psoriasis, lung issues such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), immune issues such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and neurological issues such as depression.

Ask your doctor about TRP disorders, and any test-of-treatment steps? For example, research papers show that some people with TRP disorders feel improvements when taking oral capsaicin, or very cold plunges, or topical menthol, or peppermint oil. If you try each of these on its own, and feel better, then a TRP disorder becomes more likely, and a mast cell disorder becomes less likely. Be aware that some mast cell patients have severe mast cell reactions to each of these treatments, so try them carefully, and be sure you have someone with you who can help you if needed.

Ask your doctor about trying electro-acupuncture because it's proven effective for some TPR disorder variants, and also has helped some mast cell disorder patients.
