# Home hunting

Home hunting means looking for a place to live, such as an apartment, condo, house, etc. This page has advice.

* **Ask a realtor**: Get advice because this is a major step and you have special requests. A good realtor can make sure the condo matches what you need, and that relevant inspections are done correctly.

* **Outdoor entrance**: MCAS is so strange, and there's no practical way to control any shared hallways, elevators, etc. as you know.

* **Tenant commitments**: Some buildings have tenant commitments to health-friendly practices, such as hypoallergenic cleaning, fragrance-free shared areas, smoke-free floors, or pet-free buildings. Some apartment buildings in neighborhoods near hospitals do even more. Ask the realtor for guidance.

* **GreenGuard certification**: This ensures the products used are low-reaction, and also ensures that the builders are committed to certification. You could/should ask a local interior architect about these, and pay for that time.

* **Inspections**: Before you fully commit, do home inspections.  A good realtor will be able to write these into your contract. For example, do a mold inspection such as [Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI)](../environmental-relative-moldiness-index/) or [Health Effects Roster of Type-Specific Formers of Mycotoxins and Inflammagens - 2nd Version (HERTSMI-2)](../health-effects-roster-of-type-specific-formers-of-mycotoxins-and-inflammagens-2/).

* **Rental heating/cooling**: For a rental or lease, prefer heating and cooling that you can fully control. Look for baseboard heating, or radiator heating, or a mini split, which is self contained heating and cooling system and can even be a room unit that is mounted on a wall. If the home has its own forced air system, then request that the filters and ducts be cleaned as part of your contract. Avoid rentals with shared forced air systems.
