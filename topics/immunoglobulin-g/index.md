# Immunoglobulin G (IgG)

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most abundant class of antibodies found in the bloodstream and extracellular fluids. It plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response, providing defense against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

**Key points**:

* **Neutralization**: IgG antibodies can neutralize pathogens by binding to them and blocking their ability to infect host cells.

* **Opsonization**: IgG antibodies can coat pathogens, marking them for destruction by phagocytes (such as macrophages and neutrophils) through a process called opsonization.

* **Activation of Complement**: IgG antibodies can activate the complement system, a group of proteins that enhances the immune response by promoting inflammation, attracting immune cells to the site of infection, and directly lysing pathogens.

* **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: IgG antibodies can stimulate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells to recognize and destroy cells coated with antibodies, such as virus-infected cells or tumor cells.

* **Role in Immunity**: IgG antibodies play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity. They provide long-lasting protection against pathogens by forming memory B cells, which can rapidly produce specific antibodies upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, leading to a faster and more effective immune response.

* **Diagnostics**: Blood tests for IgG antibodies can assess immune function, detect past or current infections, and diagnose autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, the presence of specific IgG antibodies to a particular pathogen in the blood can indicate a previous exposure or vaccination.
