# Folate metabolism

Folate metabolism, also known as the folate cycle, is a crucial biochemical process involving the vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9. This process is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, as well as for amino acid metabolism. Folate is obtained from dietary sources such as leafy greens, legumes, and fortified foods, and it must be converted into its active form, tetrahydrofolate (THF), to participate in cellular functions.

The metabolism of folate begins with its absorption in the small intestine. Once inside the cells, folate is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) and then to THF by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF acts as a carrier of one-carbon units, which are necessary for the synthesis of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA and RNA. This makes folate vital for cell division and growth, particularly during periods of rapid growth such as pregnancy and infancy.

One of the key pathways involving folate is the methylation cycle, where THF is converted into 5,10-methylene-THF and then to 5-methyl-THF. The latter donates a methyl group to homocysteine, converting it into methionine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase, with vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Methionine can then be converted into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions, impacting gene expression and protein function.

Deficiencies in folate can lead to various health issues, including megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the production of abnormally large and immature red blood cells. In pregnant women, inadequate folate intake is associated with neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Therefore, adequate folate intake and metabolism are vital for overall health, supporting essential cellular processes and ensuring proper growth and development.
