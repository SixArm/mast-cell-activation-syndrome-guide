# G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large and diverse group of membrane proteins that play a crucial role in cellular communication and signal transduction. These receptors respond to a wide variety of external signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and environmental stimuli, by activating intracellular G-proteins. This activation triggers a cascade of signaling pathways that regulate numerous physiological processes.

Structurally, GPCRs are characterized by their seven transmembrane helices, which span the cell membrane. Upon binding to their specific ligand, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, the receptor undergoes a conformational change. This change enables the GPCR to interact with and activate G-proteins, which are composed of three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma. The activated G-protein then dissociates into its alpha and beta-gamma subunits, each of which can modulate different intracellular signaling pathways.

GPCRs are involved in many critical functions within the body, including sensory perception (such as vision, taste, and smell), immune response, and regulation of mood and metabolism. For instance, beta-adrenergic receptors, a type of GPCR, play a key role in the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline, influencing heart rate and blood pressure.

Due to their central role in many physiological processes, GPCRs are a major target for pharmaceutical drug development. Drugs that target GPCRs are used to treat a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders, and asthma.
