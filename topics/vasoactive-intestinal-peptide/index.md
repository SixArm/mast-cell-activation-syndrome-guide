# Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)

Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract, vascular system, and immune system.

**Key points:**

* **Receptors**: VIP receptors are present on various cell types, including smooth muscle cells, immune cells, and glandular cells.

* **Gastrointestinal Effects**: In the gastrointestinal tract, VIP has several effects, including the relaxation of smooth muscle, stimulation of secretion from glands, and modulation of nutrient absorption.

* **Vasodilation**: VIP acts as a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes blood vessels, leading to an increase in blood flow.

* **Effects**: VIP has immunomodulatory properties, influencing the activity of immune cells. It can suppress inflammation and enhance anti-inflammatory responses.

* **Neurotransmitter Function**: VIP acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system. It is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep-wake cycles, and various neuroendocrine functions.

* **VIPoma**: In rare cases, tumors called VIPomas can develop, leading to excessive production of VIP.

* **Therapeutic Applications**: VIP, and synthetic analogs such as CirsVIP, have been potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and septic shock.
