# Four-point salivary cortisol level test

The four-point salivary cortisol level test is a comprehensive assessment used to evaluate the diurnal rhythm of cortisol production over the course of a day. This test involves collecting saliva samples at four specific times: early morning upon waking, around noon, late afternoon, and before bedtime. These points provide a detailed profile of how cortisol levels fluctuate throughout the day.

Cortisol is a crucial hormone produced by the adrenal glands, playing a vital role in stress response, metabolism, and immune function. Normally, cortisol levels peak in the early morning, gradually decline throughout the day, and reach their lowest point at night. The four-point salivary cortisol test helps identify deviations from this pattern, which can indicate various health issues such as adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, or chronic stress.

The test is non-invasive and can be conveniently performed at home. Patients use a saliva collection kit to gather samples at the specified times, then send these samples to a laboratory for analysis. The results provide a comprehensive overview of cortisol secretion patterns, allowing healthcare providers to identify abnormal rhythms that may contribute to health problems.

For instance, a flattened cortisol curve might suggest adrenal fatigue or dysfunction, often associated with chronic stress or burnout. Conversely, elevated cortisol levels throughout the day could indicate hypercortisolism or Cushing's syndrome.
