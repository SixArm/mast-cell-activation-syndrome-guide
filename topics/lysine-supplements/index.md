# Lysine supplements

Lysine is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot produce it and it must be obtained through diet or supplements. Lysine supplements offer a range of health benefits, from supporting muscle and bone health to enhancing skin and immune function. 

Lysine is involved in protein synthesis, which is crucial for muscle growth, tissue repair, and the production of enzymes and hormones. This makes lysine particularly beneficial for athletes and individuals recovering from injuries. Additionally, lysine aids in the absorption of calcium, promoting bone health and helping prevent conditions like osteoporosis.

Lysine is also known for its role in collagen formation, which is vital for maintaining healthy skin, cartilage, and connective tissues. By supporting collagen production, lysine helps improve skin elasticity and wound healing, making it a valuable supplement for skin health.

Lysine has been studied for its potential to support the immune system. It is believed to help in the production of antibodies and enzymes that combat viruses and bacteria, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of infections such as cold sores caused by the herpes simplex virus.
