# Cricopharyngeal spasm

Cricopharyngeal spasm, also known as upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction or cricopharyngeal dysfunction, is a condition characterized by the abnormal contraction of the cricopharyngeal muscle, which is a ring-like muscle at the top of the esophagus. This muscle normally helps prevent air from entering the esophagus during breathing and prevents reflux of stomach contents into the throat. 

**Key points:**

* **Symptoms:** Throat pain or discomfort, such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) that feels like a sensation of food sticking in the throat or chest, or globus that feels like a lump or tightness in the throat unrelated to swallowing. 

* **Causes:** Unclear. May be associated with conditions such as [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)](../gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/), neurological disorders, or psychological factors.

* **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is typically based on the clinical presentation and may involve an endoscopy to examine the esophagus, a barium swallow study (a radiologic test to visualize the swallowing process), and esophageal manometry (a measure of muscle contractions and coordination in the esophagus).

* **Treatment:** Treatment approaches may include therapy to improve swallowing and relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle; medications such as muscle relaxants or certain antidepressants; botox injections to relax the muscle, or surgery for severe cases.
  
* **Management:** Lifestyle and dietary modifications, such as eating smaller meals, avoiding late-night meals, and avoiding trigger foods, may help manage symptoms. Managing underlying conditions, such as GERD, may help.
