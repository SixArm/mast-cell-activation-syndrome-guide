# Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol)

Colesevelam is a medication classified as a bile acid sequestrant. It is used primarily to lower elevated levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the blood. Like other medications in this class, colesevelam works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, thereby reducing the reabsorption of bile acids and promoting the elimination of cholesterol from the body.

Colesevelam is part of a comprehensive treatment plan that often includes dietary and lifestyle modifications. It's essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan.

### Uses

Colesevelam is prescribed to individuals with high cholesterol, specifically high LDL cholesterol levels.

It is typically used in conjunction with dietary modifications and lifestyle changes to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### How It Works

Colesevelam, like other bile acid sequestrants, is not absorbed into the bloodstream. It works locally within the gastrointestinal tract.

It binds to bile acids, which are necessary for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

By binding to bile acids, colesevelam reduces their reabsorption, leading to increased excretion of bile acids and cholesterol. This results in a reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol levels.

### Administration

Colesevelam is available in tablet form and is taken orally.

The dose and frequency are determined by a healthcare provider based on an individual's cholesterol levels and response to treatment.

It is generally taken with meals to maximize its cholesterol-lowering effects.

### Effectiveness

Colesevelam is effective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels when used as directed. It may also have a modest impact on reducing triglyceride levels.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include constipation, stomach discomfort, gas, and nausea.

Colesevelam may interfere with the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Monitoring and supplementation of these vitamins may be necessary.

Drinking plenty of fluids while taking colesevelam can help prevent constipation.

### Interactions

Colesevelam can interact with other medications, potentially reducing their absorption. To prevent interactions, it is recommended to take other medications at least one hour before or four to six hours after taking colesevelam.

### Contraindications

Colesevelam should not be used in individuals with a history of bowel obstructions or certain gastrointestinal disorders.

### Duration of Use

Colesevelam is generally used as a long-term treatment. The duration of use is determined by a healthcare provider based on individual needs and response to treatment.

### Monitoring

Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to monitor cholesterol levels and assess the effectiveness of treatment.
