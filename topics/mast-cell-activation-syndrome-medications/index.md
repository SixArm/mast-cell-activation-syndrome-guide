# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS): medications

 Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) treatments can use medications such as:

* **Antihistamines**: Non-sedating, second-generation [antihistamines](../antihistamines/) like [cetirizine](../cetirizine/), [loratadine](../loratadine/), or [fexofenadine](../fexofenadine) are commonly used to block the effects of histamine and manage symptoms such as itching, flushing, and hives.

* **Mast Cell Stabilizers**: Medications like [cromolyn sodium](../cromolyn-sodium) or [ketotifen](../ketotifen/) can help stabilize mast cells and reduce their reactivity.

* **Leukotriene Modifiers**: [Montelukast](../montelukast/) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that may be prescribed to manage respiratory and other symptoms.

* **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: [Omeprazole](../omeprazole) can help manage gastrointestinal symptoms by reducing stomach acid production.

* **Adrenaline Auto-Injector**: Individuals with MCAS who are at risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be prescribed an [adrenaline auto-injector](../adrenaline-auto-injector) and trained on how to use it in case of an emergency.

* **Mast Cell Stabilizing Medications**: In more severe cases of MCAS, medications like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. [imatinib](../imatinib/)) or anti-IgE therapy (e.g. [omalizumab](../omalizumab/)) may be considered to manage symptoms and mast cell activation.
