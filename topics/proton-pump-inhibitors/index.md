# Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications used to reduce the production of stomach acid. They work by inhibiting the activity of proton pumps in the stomach lining, which are responsible for the secretion of acid into the stomach.

PPIs are commonly prescribed to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and other conditions where excessive stomach acid production causes symptoms such as heartburn, acid reflux, and stomach pain.

Examples: omeprazole (brand name Prilosec), esomeprazole (brand name Nexium), lansoprazole (brand name Prevacid), pantoprazole (brand name Protonix), rabeprazole (brand name Aciphex).

PPIs are usually taken orally, typically once a day before a meal, although the dosage and frequency may vary depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.

PPIs are generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, they can have side effects. Common side effects of PPIs may include headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. Long-term use of PPIs has been associated with certain risks, including an increased risk of bone fractures, vitamin B12 deficiency, and an increased risk of certain infections.
