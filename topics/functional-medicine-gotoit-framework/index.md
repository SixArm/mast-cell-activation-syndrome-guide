# Functional medicine GOTOIT framework

The functional medicine GOTOIT framework is a structured approach used in functional medicine for organizing and prioritizing the evaluation and treatment of patients. Developed by the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM), the GOTOIT framework provides a systematic way to assess and address the multiple factors that contribute to an individual's health and well-being.

The GOTOIT framework emphasizes a patient-centered and collaborative approach to healthcare, where the patient's unique needs, preferences, and values are central to the evaluation and treatment process. By systematically addressing the multiple factors that influence health and well-being, the GOTOIT framework aims to promote optimal health outcomes and empower patients to take an active role in their own care.

The acronym "GOTOIT" stands for:

* **Gather**: The first step in the GOTOIT framework involves gathering relevant information about the patient's health history, including medical history, family history, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and current symptoms. This may include conducting a comprehensive intake interview, reviewing medical records, and performing relevant physical exams or laboratory tests.

* **Organize**: Once the information has been gathered, it is organized into a structured format to identify patterns, connections, and areas of concern. This may involve using tools such as the Functional Medicine Matrix or other assessment frameworks to categorize and prioritize the patient's health issues and underlying imbalances.

* **Tell the story**: In this step, the healthcare practitioner works with the patient to create a comprehensive narrative or "story" that integrates the information gathered and organized in the previous steps. This narrative helps to clarify the patient's health goals, concerns, and priorities, as well as the underlying factors contributing to their health challenges.

* **Outcome goals**: Based on the patient's story and health priorities, specific outcome goals are established to guide the treatment plan. These goals should be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, and they should reflect the patient's desired improvements in health and well-being.

* **Interventions**: With outcome goals established, the healthcare practitioner selects and implements interventions aimed at addressing the underlying imbalances and supporting the patient's journey toward improved health. Interventions may include dietary and lifestyle changes, nutritional supplementation, stress management techniques, physical activity, and mind-body therapies, among others.

* **Track**: Finally, the progress of the patient's treatment plan is tracked and monitored over time to assess effectiveness, adjust interventions as needed, and achieve desired outcomes. This may involve regular follow-up visits, reassessment of symptoms and clinical markers, and ongoing collaboration between the patient and healthcare practitioner.
