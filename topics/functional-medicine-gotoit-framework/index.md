# Functional medicine GOTOIT framework

The functional medicine GOTOIT framework provides a systematic way to assess and address an individual's health and well-being.

**The acronym "GOTOIT" stands for**:

* **1. Gather**: Gather relevant information about the patient's health history, family history, lifestyle, exposures, and symptoms. This may include an intake interview, review of medical records, physical exams, or laboratory tests.

* **2. Organize**: Organize data into a structured format to identify patterns, connections, and areas of concern. This may involve using tools such as the Functional Medicine Matrix to prioritize the patient's health issues and underlying imbalances.

* **3. Tell the story**: Create a comprehensive narrative or "story" that integrates the information. Clarify the patient's health goals, concerns, and priorities, as well as the underlying factors contributing to their health challenges.

* **4. Outcome goals**: Establish outcome goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Goals are the patient's desired improvements.

* **5. Interventions**: Implement interventions to improve health. These may include dietary changes, lifestyle changes, stress management techniques, physical activity, and mind-body therapies, among others.

* **6. Track**: Track the treatment over time to assess effectiveness, adjust interventions as needed, and achieve desired outcomes. This may involve follow-up visits, reassessments, and ongoing collaboration.
