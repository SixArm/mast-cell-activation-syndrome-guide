# Functional medicine GOTOIT framework

The functional medicine GOTOIT framework provides a systematic way to assess and address the multiple factors that contribute to an individual's health and well-being.

**The acronym "GOTOIT" stands for**:

* **1. Gather**: Gather relevant information about the patient's health history, including medical history, family history, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and current symptoms. This may include conducting a comprehensive intake interview, reviewing medical records, and performing relevant physical exams or laboratory tests.

* **2. Organize**: Organize data into a structured format to identify patterns, connections, and areas of concern. This may involve using tools such as the Functional Medicine Matrix or other assessment frameworks to categorize and prioritize the patient's health issues and underlying imbalances.

* **3. Tell the story**: Create a comprehensive narrative or "story" that integrates the information gathered and organized in the previous steps. Clarify the patient's health goals, concerns, and priorities, as well as the underlying factors contributing to their health challenges.

* **4. Outcome goals**: Establish specific outcome goals to guide the treatment plan. These goals should be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, and they should reflect the patient's desired improvements in health and well-being.

* **5. Interventions**: Implement interventions aimed at addressing the underlying imbalances and supporting the patient's journey toward improved health. Interventions may include dietary and lifestyle changes, nutritional supplementation, stress management techniques, physical activity, and mind-body therapies, among others.

* **6. Track**: Track the treatment over time to assess effectiveness, adjust interventions as needed, and achieve desired outcomes. This may involve regular follow-up visits, reassessment of symptoms and clinical markers, and ongoing collaboration between the patient and healthcare practitioner.
