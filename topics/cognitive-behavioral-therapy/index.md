# Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely used therapeutic approach that focuses on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It is an evidence-based psychological treatment that has been applied to a variety of mental health conditions.

**Key points**:

* **Core Principles**: CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interconnected. It recognizes that changing negative thought patterns and behaviors can positively impact emotional well-being.

* **Collaborative and Goal-Oriented**: CBT is a collaborative process between the therapist and the individual seeking therapy. It is goal-oriented, with a focus on identifying and addressing specific problems or challenges.

* **Identification of Distorted Thinking**: CBT involves identifying and challenging distorted or negative thought patterns. These patterns, known as cognitive distortions, can contribute to emotional distress.

* **Behavioral Techniques**: CBT incorporates behavioral techniques to modify actions and behaviors. This may involve developing new coping strategies, changing habits, or facing fears through exposure therapy.

* **Structured Sessions**: CBT sessions are typically structured, with a focus on addressing specific issues during each session. Homework assignments may be given to reinforce and practice new skills outside of therapy sessions.

* **Applicability to Various Conditions**: CBT has been adapted and proven effective for a range of mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and more.
