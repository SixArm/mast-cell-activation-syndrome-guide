# Garlic  allergy

[Source](https://www.allergycliniclondon.co.uk/three-less-common-food-allergies-you-might-not-know-about/)

Garlic adds a lot of flavour to our meals, but it could also add a lot of problems to your life. If you suffer from an allergy rather than an intolerance, expect to see hives, itching in your mouth and throat, a runny nose, sneezing, and stomach cramps.

Garlic is cross-reactive. Meaning if youâ€™re allergic, you should also be wary of onions, leeks, chives, and shallots.
