# Despair

TODO

"I feel so bad right now. This year my flare has completely ruined my health and
I can feel people around getting tired of me and frustrated with me and less
understanding. My own mother now is even sick of me and without her saying the
word burden I know she feels like I am. They keep trying to get me to eat foods
I know I’ll react to. I can’t take any antihistamines either. As rescue meds I
only have an epipen. I feel so alone and I knew people were going to abandon me
and gaslight me just like the doctors but I just didn’t want to believe it. Like
just now I got into an argument because I have no safe foods besides “broth” and
my mom said it’s just anxiety eat something real. I knew I was becoming a burden
I just didn’t want to believe it that’s why I kept myself away for so long. I
can’t stop crying right I feel so hopeless and I’m losing the only in person
support I have. God I hate this disease I literally wish I was never born
sometimes. Then maybe everyone would be a little happier."
