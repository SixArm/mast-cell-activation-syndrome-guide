# Growth hormone (GH)

Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin, is a crucial hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It plays a vital role in growth, metabolism, and overall development in both children and adults.

In children, GH is essential for normal growth and development. It stimulates the growth of bones and cartilage, which is critical during the growing years. Adequate levels of GH ensure that children achieve their full height potential and develop proper bone density. A deficiency in GH can lead to growth disorders such as dwarfism, while excess GH can cause gigantism, characterized by excessive growth and abnormal height.

In adults, GH continues to play a significant role in maintaining healthy body composition, metabolism, and overall physiological function. It helps regulate body fat distribution, muscle mass, and bone density. GH also influences lipid metabolism and glucose regulation, contributing to energy balance and metabolic health. In adults, GH deficiency can lead to symptoms like increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, and reduced energy levels, while excess GH can cause acromegaly, a condition marked by abnormal growth of hands, feet, and facial features.

GH testing is crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions related to abnormal growth hormone levels. Blood tests measuring GH or its regulatory hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), help diagnose GH deficiencies or excesses and guide appropriate treatment. Proper regulation of GH levels is essential for optimal health and well-being throughout life.
