# Short-term disability (STD) insurance

Short-term disability (STD) insurance is a type of coverage that provides financial support to individuals who are temporarily unable to work due to a medical condition, injury, or illness. This insurance is designed to bridge the income gap during the initial period of disability, typically covering a portion of the policyholder’s salary for a period ranging from a few weeks up to six months. Beyond this duration, some people use long-term disability (LTD) insurance.

These policies generally replace about 60% to 70% of the policyholder’s pre-disability income, offering a critical lifeline to help cover essential living expenses and medical costs during recovery. The specifics of coverage, including the benefit amount, duration, and waiting period (the time between the onset of disability and when benefits begin), can vary widely depending on the policy and provider.

Eligibility for STD benefits usually requires medical documentation confirming the disability. Common conditions covered by STD insurance include recovery from surgery, significant injuries, severe illnesses, and, in many cases, pregnancy and childbirth-related conditions. Employers often provide STD insurance as part of their employee benefits package, but it can also be purchased individually.

The goal of STD insurance is to provide financial stability and peace of mind during short-term health setbacks, enabling individuals to focus on recovery without the added stress of lost income. Understanding the details of one’s STD policy is essential to ensuring adequate protection and effective use of the benefits when needed.
