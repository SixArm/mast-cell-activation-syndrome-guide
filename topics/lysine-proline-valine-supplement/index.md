# Lysine-proline-valine (KPV) supplement

Lysine-proline-valine (KPV) is a tripeptide supplement gaining attention for its potential health benefits. It is a combination of three essential amino acids: lysine, proline, and valine.

These amino acids synergistically enhance their individual benefits. KPV is noted for its anti-inflammatory properties, which may aid in reducing inflammation and promoting healing in the body. Preliminary studies suggest that KPV might have protective effects against certain chronic conditions, though more research is needed.

* **Lysine** is crucial for protein synthesis, calcium absorption, and the production of hormones and enzymes. It also plays a vital role in immune function and collagen formation, which is essential for healthy skin, bones, and connective tissues.

* **Proline** is integral to the synthesis of collagen and cartilage, aiding in tissue repair and wound healing. Additionally, proline supports cardiovascular health by assisting in the maintenance of blood vessel integrity.

* **Valine** is vital for muscle growth, tissue repair, and energy production. It is especially beneficial for athletes and individuals engaged in strenuous physical activities, as it helps reduce muscle fatigue and improve recovery.
