# Far-UVC light

Far-UVC light is emerging as a promising tool for disinfection. Unlike
traditional germicidal UVC light (254 nm), far-UVC light (207-222 nm) can
inactivate bacteria and viruses without posing a significant risk to human
health. This is because far-UVC light has a shorter wavelength, which is
absorbed by the outer layer of human skin and eyes, preventing it from
penetrating and causing damage.

Research has demonstrated the efficacy of far-UVC light in killing airborne
pathogens, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, making it a potential
solution for reducing the spread of infectious diseases in public spaces. Its
safety profile allows for continuous use in occupied environments such as
hospitals, schools, airports, and other high-traffic areas, providing a
continuous and effective means of disinfection.

Far-UVC light works by breaking the molecular bonds in the DNA and RNA of
microorganisms, effectively rendering them inactive. Its ability to safely and
continuously disinfect surfaces and air highlights its potential for enhancing
public health measures, especially in the context of pandemic preparedness.
