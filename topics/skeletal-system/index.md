# Skeletal system

The skeletal system is the framework of bones and connective tissues that provides structure, support, and protection to the human body. It consists of 206 bones in adults, which are categorized into the axial and appendicular skeletons. The axial skeleton includes the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, while the appendicular skeleton comprises the limbs, shoulder girdle, and pelvic girdle.

Bones serve several crucial functions. They protect vital organs—such as the brain, heart, and lungs—by encasing them in hard, protective structures. The skeletal system also enables movement by serving as attachment points for muscles. When muscles contract, they pull on bones, facilitating locomotion and various physical activities.

Additionally, bones play a vital role in mineral storage and blood cell production. They act as reservoirs for minerals like calcium and phosphorus, releasing them into the bloodstream as needed to maintain mineral balance and support physiological processes. The bone marrow, found in the hollow interiors of certain bones, is the site of hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Joints, where two or more bones meet, allow for flexibility and movement. They are classified based on their structure and function, with types including synovial (freely movable), cartilaginous (partially movable), and fibrous (immovable) joints.

Maintaining bone health is essential for the skeletal system's proper function. Factors such as adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, regular weight-bearing exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are critical for preventing bone-related disorders like osteoporosis and fractures. Understanding and caring for the skeletal system ensures overall physical health and mobility.
