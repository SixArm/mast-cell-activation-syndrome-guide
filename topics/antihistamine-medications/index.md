# Antihistamine medications

Antihistamine medications are a class of drugs commonly used to relieve allergy symptoms and manage various allergic conditions. They work by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens. 

First-generation antihistamines have been in use for many years and are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are effective but often cause drowsiness and may impair cognitive and motor skills.

* Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
* Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton)
* Clemastine (Tavist)
* Promethazine (Phenergan)

Second-generation antihistamines are newer and have been developed to reduce drowsiness and other side effects commonly associated with first-generation antihistamines. 

* Loratadine (Claritin)
* Cetirizine (Zyrtec)
* Fexofenadine (Allegra)
* Desloratadine (Clarinex)
* Ketotifen (Zaditor)

Third-generation antihistamines are similar to second-generation antihistamines in terms of reduced sedation but may have a faster onset of action and longer duration of effect. 

* Levocetirizine (Xyzal)
* Desloratadine (Clarinex)
* Bilastine (Blexten)

Prescription antihistamines are used to treat severe allergies or chronic conditions.

* Azelastine (Astelin)
* Olopatadine (Patanase)
* Cyproheptadine (Periactin)
