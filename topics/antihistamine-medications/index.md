# Antihistamine medications

Antihistamine medications are a class of drugs commonly used to relieve allergy symptoms and manage various allergic conditions. They work by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.

First-generation antihistamines have been in use for many years. They are effective but often cause drowsiness and may impair cognitive and motor skills.

* [Diphenhydramine](../diphenhydramine/) (brand name: Benadryl)
* [Chlorpheniramine](../chlorpheniramine/) (brand name: Chlor-Trimeton)
* [Clemastine](../clemastine/) (brand name: Tavist)
* [Promethazine](../promethazine/) (brand name: Phenergan)

Second-generation antihistamines are newer and have been developed to reduce drowsiness and other side effects.

* [Loratadine](../loratadine/) (brand name: Claritin)
* [Cetirizine](../cetirizine/) (brand name: Zyrtec)
* [Fexofenadine](../fexofenadine/) (brand name: Allegra)
* [Ketotifen](../ketotifen/) (brand name: Zaditor)

Third-generation antihistamines are similar to second-generation antihistamines plus have a faster onset and longer duration.

* [Levocetirizine](../levocetirizine/) (brand name: Xyzal)
* [Desloratadine](../desloratadine/) (brand name: Clarinex)
* [Bilastine](../bilastine/) (brand name: Blexten)

Prescription antihistamines are used to treat severe allergies or chronic conditions.

* [Cyproheptadine](../cyproheptadine/) (brand name: Periactin)
