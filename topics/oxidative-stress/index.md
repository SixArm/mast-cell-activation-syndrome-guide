# Oxidative stress

TODO

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body’s ability to detoxify these harmful byproducts or repair the resulting damage. ROS, including free radicals, are highly reactive molecules generated during normal cellular metabolism and in response to environmental factors such as pollution, radiation, and smoking.

Under normal conditions, the body employs a sophisticated system of antioxidants, such as glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E, to neutralize ROS and prevent cellular damage. However, when ROS production exceeds the capacity of antioxidant defenses, oxidative stress ensues. This imbalance can lead to damage of cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, which can disrupt normal cell function and contribute to various diseases.

Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and certain cancers. It is also associated with aging and age-related functional declines. The cumulative damage caused by oxidative stress can impair cellular processes and promote inflammation, further exacerbating disease progression.

Mitigating oxidative stress involves enhancing the body’s antioxidant defenses through dietary intake of antioxidant-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and possibly through supplementation. Lifestyle modifications, such as reducing exposure to environmental toxins, exercising regularly, and managing stress, also play crucial roles in maintaining oxidative balance and promoting overall health.

Understanding and addressing oxidative stress is essential for preventing and managing chronic diseases, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach to health that includes diet, lifestyle, and potentially targeted therapeutic interventions.
