# Bradycardia

Bradycardia is a medical term used to describe an abnormally slow heart rate, typically defined as a resting heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults.

**Key aspects**:

* **Normal Physiological Variations**: In some individuals, a heart rate below 60 BPM may be normal, especially in well-trained athletes or during deep sleep.

* **Aging**: As people get older, it's not uncommon for the heart's natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial (SA) node, to slow down, leading to a lower resting heart rate.

* **Medications**: Some medications, particularly those used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions, can slow the heart rate as a side effect.

* **Heart Block**: This is a condition where the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked as they move through the heart's electrical system. 

* **Sick Sinus Syndrome**: This is a disorder of the heart's electrical system that can cause the heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or irregularly.

* **Vagal Stimulation**: The vagus nerve, which plays a role in regulating heart rate, can be stimulated by factors such as vomiting, straining during bowel movements, or carotid sinus massage, leading to bradycardia.

* **Underlying Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, electrolyte imbalances, and infections affecting the heart, can lead to bradycardia.

* **Symptoms**: dizziness, fatigue, weakness, fainting (syncope), shortness of breath, chest pain.

* **Treatment**: May include medications such as antiarrhythmics or heart stimulators. A pacemaker implant may help. Lifestyle changes involve staying well-hydrated and avoiding excessive alcohol and caffeine.
