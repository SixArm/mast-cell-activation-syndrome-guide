# Microbiota

Microbiota refers to the diverse community of microorganisms that inhabit a particular environment, such as the human body or specific ecological niches. These microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and other single-celled organisms.

The human microbiota is highly diverse, with trillions of microorganisms representing thousands of different species. Each region of the body, such as the skin, mouth, gut, and other mucosal surfaces, has its own distinct microbiota.

**Key points:**

* **Human Microbiota**: The human microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health and contributing to various physiological functions, including digestion, nutrient absorption, metabolism, and immune system development.

* **Functions**: Microbiota contribute to host health through functions such as nutrient metabolism, production of short-chain fatty acids, synthesis of certain vitamins, modulation of the immune system, and protection against pathogenic invaders.

* **Dysbiosis**: Imbalances or disruptions in the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with various health conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, and immune-related conditions.

* **Dynamic**: The composition of the microbiota is dynamic and can be influenced by various factors, including diet, lifestyle, antibiotic use, environmental exposures, and genetics.

* **Prebiotics and Probiotics**: Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth and activity of beneficial microorganisms. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. These are commonly used to support a healthy microbiota.
