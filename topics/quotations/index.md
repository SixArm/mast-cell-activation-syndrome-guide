# Quotations

"For months I had an exclusive diet of rice, chicken, carrots, cooked apples. I noticed a change in my body that prompted me to introduce new foods and now I can eat potatoes, blueberries, sweet potatoes, cola, coffee, ginger ale, meat, tea . During all these months I have taken care of my diet, I have tried to relax, calm my central nervous system and take my medications (fexofenadine am and pm, glutamine, vitamin d3, vitamin c, probiotic, montelukast). I believe that healing is possible and that is what I wish for everyone."

"I’ve been in the ER 30 times in the past year."

"I react to everything I eat. I am on h1 antihistamines, h2 antihistamines, sodium cromolyn, ketotifen and quercetin. I had to leave my job six months ago and am now basically bed bound. I don’t want to live like this anymore. Please send hope."

"My doctor told me I would be patient zero.”

"I had an argument with my previous doctor. She kept saying, well, if antihistamines help you why don’t you just take those? I told her why take antihistamines if a mast cell stabilizer does the job first? She was very resistant to the idea of a mast cell stabilizer… God knows why."

"Seeing how people get treated, I'd just like to say a big FUCK YOU to the bad doctors that treat patients like trash because of their own inadequacies as medical professionals. I despise pompous attitudes in the medical community; more often than not it's the type of doctor that doesn't bother reading up on the latest research concerning a patient's condition because they simply don't care enough or are arrogant enough to think their uninformed opinion is better than a lived experience."
