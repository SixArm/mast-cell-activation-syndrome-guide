# Hives

Hives, also known as urticaria, are a common skin reaction characterized by raised, red, and itchy welts or bumps. They can vary in size and shape and may appear suddenly on any part of the body. Hives are often accompanied by itching, which can be severe and disruptive.

The underlying cause of hives can be varied and may include allergic reactions to certain foods (e.g., nuts, shellfish, eggs), medications (e.g., antibiotics, aspirin), insect stings, latex, or environmental triggers (e.g., pollen, pet dander). Other non-allergic triggers such as physical stimuli (heat, cold, pressure), sunlight, exercise, water, infections, stress, and underlying medical conditions like autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, and viral infections may also cause hives.

Treatment for hives typically involves addressing the underlying cause and providing relief from symptoms. This may include the use of over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines to reduce itching and swelling. Non-sedating antihistamines like loratadine, cetirizine, or fexofenadine are commonly recommended. Topical treatments such as calamine lotion, corticosteroid creams, or oral corticosteroids may also be used to relieve itching and inflammation.

Identifying and avoiding triggers that cause hives is essential. This may involve keeping a diary of symptoms and potential triggers or undergoing allergy testing to identify specific allergens. In severe cases of anaphylaxis or when hives are accompanied by difficulty breathing or other signs of a severe allergic reaction, epinephrine may be administered with an auto-injector like Auvi-Q.

For chronic hives that persist despite treatment, additional medications such as omalizumab (Xolair), cyclosporine, or montelukast may be recommended. While hives are typically not life-threatening, they can be uncomfortable and distressing. It's important to seek medical attention if hives are severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or dizziness.
