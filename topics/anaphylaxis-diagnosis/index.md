# Anaphylaxis diagnosis

Diagnosing anaphylaxis is primarily based on clinical evaluation and a thorough medical history, as well as the recognition of characteristic signs and symptoms that occur after exposure to an allergen or trigger.

**Key points**:

* **Medical History**: A provider will take a detailed medical history, which includes asking about the individual's symptoms, the timing of symptom onset in relation to exposure to a potential allergen or trigger, and any known allergies or previous episodes of anaphylaxis.

* **Physical Examination**: A provider will assess the individual's vital signs, including pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Particular attention is given to evaluating the presence of physical signs such as hives, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or throat), and any respiratory distress.

* **Elimination of Other Causes**: A provider will consider other potential causes for the symptoms and rule out alternative diagnoses. This includes differentiating anaphylaxis from other medical conditions that may mimic its symptoms, such as severe asthma exacerbations or cardiovascular events.

* **Timing and Trigger**: A provider will assess whether the onset of symptoms occurred shortly after exposure to a known allergen or trigger, which can help confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.

* **Laboratory Tests**: While laboratory tests are not typically used for diagnosing anaphylaxis, certain tests may be performed to help confirm the diagnosis and identify potential triggers. These may include serum tryptase levels, which can be elevated in the bloodstream during anaphylaxis.
