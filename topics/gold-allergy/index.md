# Gold allergy

Gold allergy, also known as gold hypersensitivity or contact dermatitis to gold, is an allergic reaction to gold or gold-containing materials. Gold is a relatively inert metal and is generally considered hypoallergenic. However, allergic reactions to gold can occur in some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin or a predisposition to metal allergies.

Gold allergy is typically diagnosed based on a clinical evaluation of symptoms and a history of exposure to gold or gold-containing materials. Patch testing may be performed by a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific allergen triggering the reaction.

* **Other Symptoms**: Rarely, systemic symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or generalized allergic reactions may occur in individuals with severe gold allergies. However, localized skin reactions are the most common manifestation of gold allergy.
