# Mast Cell Leukemia (MCL)

Mast Cell Leukemia (MCL) is an extremely rare and aggressive form of systemic mastocytosis, a group of disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation and activation of mast cells, a type of immune cell. Mast cell leukemia is considered one of the most severe subtypes of systemic mastocytosis and is associated with a poor prognosis.

**Key points**:

* **Abnormal Mast Cells**: In MCL, there is a massive infiltration of malignant mast cells in various tissues and organs, including the bone marrow. These cells are abnormal and can release excessive amounts of chemicals, such as histamine.

* **Symptoms**: Symptoms of MCL are often severe and may include skin lesions, systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), organ enlargement, and a risk of anaphylaxis.

* **Diagnosis**: Tests can detect abnormally high number of mast cells in the bone marrow and other tissues. Molecular testing may identify specific genetic mutations.

* **Prognosis**: MCL is considered a highly aggressive condition, and the prognosis is generally poor. Progression of the disease is rapid. Treatment options are limited.

* **Treatment**: The treatment of MCL is challenging due to its aggressiveness. It may involve [antihistamines](../antihistamines/), [corticosteroids](../corticosteroids/), and medications to stabilize mast cells. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplant/) may be considered.
