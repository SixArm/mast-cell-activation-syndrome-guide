# Ginger herbal infusion

[Source: Healing Histamine](https://www.healinghistamine.com/blog/5-best-histamine-intolerance-teas/)

Ginger is a well-known mast cell stabilizer. It is often used as an H2 histamine blocker for indigestion and excess stomach acid, so it is very soothing to the stomach. It is also anti-inflammatory and just plain delicious.

Ginger tea is delicious with the juice of quarter to half a lemon, sweetened with honey or your choice of natural sweetener, and combined with other soothing herbs like chamomile. For ginger tea using the fresh ginger root, rather than ginger tea bags, try the following recipe.

**Ingredients**:

* 1-3 tsp freshly grated ginger root
* 1 cup boiling water

**Instructions**:

* Place the grated ginger into a glass measure cup.
* Fill to the 1 cup line with boiling water.
* Steep 10 minutes.
* Strain into a mug, sweeten to taste and enjoy.
