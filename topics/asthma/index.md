# Asthma

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways in the lungs. It is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can lead to various symptoms, including difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.

Asthma is a common condition, with millions of people affected worldwide. Asthma is a manageable condition, and many individuals with asthma lead active and healthy lives with the right treatment and proper self-management.

**Key points**:

* **Triggers**: Symptoms can be triggered by a variety of factors, including allergens, respiratory infections, irritants, exercise, occupational exposures, and stress.

* **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation of the airways makes them more sensitive to various triggers. This can lead to the symptoms and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways).

* **Diagnosis**: ATypically diagnosed based on a combination of [medical history](../medical-history/\), [physical examination](../physical-examination/), and pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, which measures lung function. [Allergy testing](../allergy-testing/) may also be performed to identify specific triggers.

* **Management**: Typically includes the following components: medications, action plan, lifestyle and environmental measures, and regular check-ups.

* **Asthma Attacks**: In severe cases, asthma attacks can occur, characterized by worsening symptoms that require immediate medical attention. Quick-relief medications, such as albuterol, are often used to manage acute attacks.
