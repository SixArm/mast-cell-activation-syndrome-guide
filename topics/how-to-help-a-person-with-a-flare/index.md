# How to help a person with a flare

Here are some things that you can try, to help a person who's having flare because of a mast cell activation syndrome.

* Stay with the person. Reassure them that this is just a reaction and will pass
  soon, and that you will stay with them. Realize the person might not be able
  to respond well or communicate coherently. This might not seem helpful or
  fruitful, yet that's OK because you're helping retrain the person's limbic
  system to know the person will recover.

* Help the person with medications. Ensure the person takes their rescue
  medications, such as antihistamines like Benadryl. Ensure the person has their
  emergency medications ready, such as an adrenaline/epinephrine injector or
  shot. The medication helps the symptoms, and also helps the person understand
  they have what they need to recover.
  
* Reduce stimulation. Lower any loud noises, bright lights, and hot
  temperatures. Send any children or pets out of the room. If the person's hands
  are moving or grasping, give something to hold like little stuffed animals.

* If the reaction is getting severe, use the EpiPen or equivalent
  adrenaline/epinephrine injector/shot, then take the person to urgent care or
  an emergency department for supervision. Get yourself 100% comfortable doing
  this because the more relaxed and calm you are about it, the better it is for
  the person having the reaction.

Each person is individual, so ideally ask the person ahead of time what they
want, and ideally practice what they want to happen ahead of time too.
