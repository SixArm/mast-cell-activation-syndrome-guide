# Vibrations quotations

"I get vibrations almost daily for years but now that I figured out the trigger of mcas and eat low histamine foods and tons of meds it’s more under control.

"For me it’s usually in my head with a rhythmic squeezing but I’ve gotten it other places too."

"Two years into the Low Histamine diet, the vibrations are greatly improving. It’s still annoying when I’m trying to sleep, but so much improved."

"I describe mine as “worms under my skin” or “club soda” or “there’s a hostage trying to poke their way out”. Last one is for when it really feels like someone is repeatedly poking me from the inside."

"Yes I get it when I drive down certain roads that aren’t smooth."

"I get full-on seizures from vibrations, especially being in my boyfriend’s truck that’s extra shaky."'

"When I have an MRI the vibrations from the machine and magnets make me sick even without contrast."

"I reacted to vibrations long before knowing I had a mast cell issue. Once I was on the train with my newborn, sleep-deprived and stressed and everything suddenly felt so overwhelming and I just felt the need to get off the train. I got off in the middle of nowhere and just thought: thank god the vibrations are over!!! the same with busses unfortunately. and certain music."

"I can’t handle jets in a hot tub or any massage that causes vibration."

"My daughter gets attacks triggered by the vibration of lawn mowers and other loud/heavy machines."

"I thought I was crazy but my husband's large truck shakes/vibrates at 40mph and the other day I thought I was gonna die from not being able to breathe when it started, like it was shaking the air out of me."

"I struggle with the vacuum or anything that causes vibrations."

"If I buzz my lips in a choral warm-up, I will struggle to sing because my throat swells."
