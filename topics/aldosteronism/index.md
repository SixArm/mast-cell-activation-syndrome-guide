# Aldosteronism

Aldosteronism, also known as hyperaldosteronism, is a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone plays a key role in regulating blood pressure by controlling the balance of sodium and potassium in the blood. When aldosterone levels are abnormally high, it leads to sodium retention and potassium excretion, causing an imbalance that affects blood pressure and fluid levels.

There are two main types of aldosteronism: primary and secondary. Primary aldosteronism, also called Conn's syndrome, occurs when the adrenal glands themselves produce too much aldosterone, often due to a benign tumor (adenoma) or adrenal hyperplasia (enlargement of the adrenal glands). Secondary aldosteronism is caused by factors outside the adrenal glands, such as kidney disease, heart failure, or liver cirrhosis, which stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more aldosterone.

Common symptoms of aldosteronism include high blood pressure that is difficult to control, muscle weakness, fatigue, headaches, and, in severe cases, episodes of paralysis due to low potassium levels (hypokalemia). Left untreated, aldosteronism can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and stroke.

Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to measure aldosterone and renin levels, imaging studies to identify adrenal abnormalities, and sometimes adrenal vein sampling to determine the source of excess aldosterone. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. For primary aldosteronism, options include surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland (adrenalectomy) or medications like mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that block the effects of aldosterone. Secondary aldosteronism treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition causing the hormone imbalance.

Effective management of aldosteronism can significantly improve symptoms and reduce the risk of long-term complications, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
