# Vitamin A (retinol)

Vitamin A (also known as retinol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various physiological functions within the body. It exists in different forms, including retinol (preformed vitamin A found in animal products) and provitamin A carotenoids (found in plant-based foods), which can be converted to active vitamin A in the body.

**Key points:**

* **Functions**: It is essential for the formation of visual pigments in the retina, contributing to low-light and color vision. It is also important for the immune system, cell differentiation, gene expression, growth, and development.

* **Sources**: Animal sources are liver, fish liver oils, egg yolks, and dairy products. Plant sources are colorful fruits and vegetables.

* **Deficiency**: Can lead to night blindness, dry skin, increased susceptibility to infections, and impaired immune function. In severe cases, it can cause blindness.

* **Toxicity**: Excessive intake of vitamin A, especially from supplements, can lead to toxicity. Symptoms may include nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, and in severe cases, more serious health issues.

* **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**: The RDA varies by age, sex, and life stage. It is expressed in both retinol activity equivalents (RAE) and international units (IU).

* **Supplementation**: For most people, obtaining vitamin A through a balanced diet is sufficient.
