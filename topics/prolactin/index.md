# Prolactin

Prolactin is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, playing a pivotal role in lactation and having diverse functions in both female and male physiology. Its primary role is to promote milk production (lactogenesis) in breastfeeding women. Prolactin levels naturally rise during pregnancy and remain elevated postpartum to facilitate milk synthesis and secretion, ensuring that the nursing infant receives adequate nutrition.

Beyond its role in lactation, prolactin influences reproductive health. In women, elevated prolactin levels can inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn suppresses ovulation and menstrual cycles. This mechanism is a natural contraceptive effect during breastfeeding but can cause fertility issues if prolactin levels remain abnormally high outside of pregnancy and lactation.

In men, prolactin is involved in the regulation of the immune system and reproductive health. High levels of prolactin can lead to a reduction in testosterone levels, potentially resulting in decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Prolactin also contributes to overall metabolic processes and has a role in the regulation of immune responses.

Prolactin levels can be affected by various factors, including stress, exercise, and medications. Disorders associated with abnormal prolactin levels, such as hyperprolactinemia, can result from pituitary tumors (prolactinomas), hypothyroidism, or side effects of certain medications. Symptoms of hyperprolactinemia include irregular menstrual periods, galactorrhea (unexpected milk production), and infertility in women, and sexual dysfunction and gynecomastia in men.

Testing for prolactin levels is crucial in diagnosing and managing conditions related to hormonal imbalances. Treatments may involve addressing underlying causes, such as thyroid disorders or pituitary tumors, and may include medications to normalize prolactin levels, thereby restoring reproductive and overall health.
