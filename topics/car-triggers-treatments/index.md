# Car triggers - treatments

Cars can have many triggers. If you react when you're in a car, then consider these tests. Try each one, and see if it makes a difference.
See [car triggers](../car-triggers) and [car triggers - treatment](../car-triggers-treatments/).

**Treatments**:

**Deep clean**: Deep clean your car. Use all hypoallergenic products. Ask a professional car detailer to do a deep clean with suitable products.

**Mold test**: Do a mold test such as [Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI)](../environmentation-relative-moldiness-index-ermi/)) or [Health Effects Roster of Type-Specific Formers of Mycotoxins and Inflammagens - 2nd Version (HERTSMI-2)](../health-effects-roster-of-type-specific-formers-of-mycotoxins-and-inflammagens-2/).

**Filters**: Replace all the car [air filters](../air-filters/). Do this regularly. Add a portable air filter, such as powered by your car's 12-volt outlet or USB outlet. Ideally use HEPA filtering and/or activated carbon filters and/or UV-light filters.

**Intangible triggers**:

* **Stress triggers**: emotional stress from going to work, anxiety from leaving the house, adrenaline increase from driving, fear of potential accidents, feeling startled, motion sickness, being with other people in the car, etc.
  
* **Energy triggers**: heat, electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as Bluetooth or WiFi, bright lights, loud sounds (even the car door closing), etc.

* **Vibrations**: If vibrations are a trigger, then ask a car mechanic for help. Consider better car shock absorbers. Check the engine mounts. Balance the tires and wheels. Tune up the engine. Ask about getting a better harmonic balancer.  Disable the stop-start system. Try driving different cars, and especially try an all-electric car.
