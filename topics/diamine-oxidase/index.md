# Diamine oxidase (DAO)

Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme found in the body that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of histamine, a biogenic amine that is involved in various physiological processes. Histamine is released in response to allergic and inflammatory reactions and is also present in certain foods. Diamine oxidase helps regulate histamine levels in the body by breaking down histamine into its metabolites.

**Key points:**

* **Digestive Health**: Diamine oxidase is mainly found in the small intestine, where it helps to prevent the absorption of excessive histamine from dietary sources. This is important because high histamine levels can lead to digestive issues and food intolerances in some individuals.

* **Histamine Metabolism**: Diamine oxidase is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down histamine within the digestive system. It does this by oxidizing histamine and converting it into its metabolites, which are less biologically active.

* **Supplements**: Some people may experience histamine intolerance, a condition in which their bodies cannot adequately break down and metabolize histamine. Diamine oxidase dietary supplements may help manage symptoms, and available over the counter.
