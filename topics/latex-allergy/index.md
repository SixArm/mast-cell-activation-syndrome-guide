# Latex allergy

Latex allergy is an allergic reaction to latex, a natural rubber material derived from the sap of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Latex is commonly used in a wide range of products, including gloves, condoms, balloons, rubber bands, medical devices, and certain types of clothing and footwear. Individuals with latex allergy develop an immune response to proteins found in natural latex rubber, leading to allergic reactions upon exposure.

Symptoms of latex allergy can range from mild to severe and may include:

* **Skin Reactions**: Contact with latex can cause itching, redness, hives (urticaria), or a rash (contact dermatitis) in the area of skin that came into contact with latex.

* **Respiratory Symptoms**: In some cases, inhaling latex particles (such as latex glove powder) can trigger respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing (shortness of breath).

* **Eye Irritation**: Contact with latex can irritate the eyes, leading to redness, itching, tearing, or conjunctivitis (pink eye).

* **Anaphylaxis**: In rare cases, exposure to latex can trigger a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, and loss of consciousness. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention and treatment with epinephrine (adrenaline) injection.

**Risk factors**:

* **Occupational Exposure**: Healthcare workers, laboratory technicians, and others who frequently use latex gloves or come into contact with latex-containing medical devices are at higher risk of developing latex allergy.

* **History of Allergies**: Individuals with a history of other allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, or allergies to certain foods (such as bananas, avocados, kiwi, chestnuts, or tomatoes), may be at increased risk of latex allergy.

* **Prior Latex Exposure**: Previous exposure to latex, particularly repeated or prolonged exposure, increases the risk of sensitization and development of latex allergy.

**Management**:

* Use latex-free gloves, medical devices, and other products whenever possible.

* Inform healthcare providers, dentists, and other caregivers about latex allergy to ensure appropriate precautions are taken during medical procedures or surgeries.

* Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace indicating latex allergy, particularly for individuals at risk of severe allergic reactions.

* Take precautions to avoid inhaling latex particles, such as avoiding areas where powdered latex gloves are used.
