# Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI)

The Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) is a tool used to assess the potential mold contamination in indoor environments. The ERMI is based on the analysis of dust samples collected from homes and measures the concentrations of specific mold species.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: ERMI provides a standardized and objective assessment of mold contamination in homes. 

* **Mold Species Included**: ERMI focuses on the analysis of DNA from specific molds commonly found indoors. 

* **Sample Collection**: To conduct an ERMI assessment, dust samples are collected from specific areas within a home, then sent to a laboratory.

* **Mold DNA Analysis**: The analysis involves the quantification of mold DNA in the dust samples. The results provide information on the concentration of the targeted mold species.

* **Interpretation**: The ERMI score is used to categorize homes into different moldiness categories. Higher ERMI scores are associated with a greater likelihood of mold contamination. 

* **Limitations**: The results do not identify the specific location of mold growth within a home, and the interpretation may vary based on individual health conditions and sensitivities.
