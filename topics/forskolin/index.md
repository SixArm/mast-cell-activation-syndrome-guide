# Forskolin

Forskolin is a natural compound found in the roots of the Indian coleus plant (Coleus forskohlii). It has been used for centuries in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat various conditions, including heart disorders, respiratory issues, and digestive disorders. Forskolin is thought to increase the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the body, which may stimulate the breakdown of fat cells and promote weight loss.

**Potential benefits**:

* **Asthma**: Some research suggests that forskolin may help relax the muscles around the bronchial tubes, making it easier to breathe. It has been investigated as a potential treatment for asthma and other respiratory conditions.

* **Heart health**: Forskolin has been studied for its potential to lower blood pressure and improve heart function. It may help dilate blood vessels and increase the strength of heart contractions.

* **Glaucoma**: There is some evidence to suggest that forskolin eye drops may help reduce intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma, although more research is needed in this area.

* **Skin conditions**: Forskolin has been investigated for its potential to treat various skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema. Some research suggests that it may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms.
