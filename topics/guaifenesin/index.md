# Guaifenesin

Guaifenesin is an expectorant medication commonly used to relieve symptoms associated with respiratory conditions such as the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory infections. It works by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and expel. Brand name: Mucinex.

Guaifenesin is often included in over-the-counter cough and cold medications, either alone or in combination with other active ingredients like decongestants or antihistamines. It is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, syrups, and extended-release formulations.

When taken as directed, guaifenesin can help alleviate symptoms such as chest congestion, cough, and throat irritation associated with respiratory illnesses. It's essential to follow the dosage instructions provided on the medication label or as directed by a healthcare professional.

Side effects of guaifenesin are generally mild and may include nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, dizziness, and headache. Serious side effects are rare but can occur. It's important to seek medical attention if you experience any severe or persistent symptoms while taking guaifenesin.

As with any medication, it's important to discuss any existing medical conditions, allergies, or medications with a healthcare provider before taking guaifenesin to ensure it is safe and appropriate for you.
