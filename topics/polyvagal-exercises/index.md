# Polyvagal exercises

Polyvagal exercises are activities or techniques designed to influence the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, particularly the polyvagal system. Polyvagal exercises aim to promote a sense of safety, social connection, and overall well-being. 

**Some exercises**:

* **Breathing Exercises**: Engage in slow, diaphragmatic breathing to stimulate the vagus nerve and activate the parasympathetic nervous system. Focus on long exhales to promote relaxation.

* **Vocal Toning**: Use gentle vocalizations, humming, or chanting. The vibrations from vocalizations can stimulate the vagus nerve.

* **Face and Neck Stretches**: Gently stretch and release tension in the muscles of the face and neck, as these areas are connected to the vagus nerve.

* **Social Engagement**: Engage in positive social interactions, whether in person or virtually. Meaningful connections with others can activate the ventral vagal complex.

* **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques**: Practice mindfulness and grounding exercises to bring attention to the present moment, promoting a sense of safety.

* **Gargling**: Gargling with water may stimulate the vagus nerve, as it involves the muscles connected to the vagus nerve.

* **Laughter and Play**: Engage in activities that bring joy, laughter, and playfulness. Positive emotions can activate the ventral vagal complex.

* **Physical Exercise**: Regular physical activity, especially activities like yoga, can have positive effects on vagal tone and overall well-being.

* **Self-Soothing Touch**: Gentle self-soothing touch, such as placing a hand on your chest or abdomen, can promote a sense of safety and comfort.

* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups, promoting overall relaxation.
