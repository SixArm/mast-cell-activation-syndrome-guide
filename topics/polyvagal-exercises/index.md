# Polyvagal exercises

Polyvagal exercises are activities to influence the functioning of the the polyvagal system and autonomic nervous system. The aim is to promote a sense of safety, social connection, and well-being.

**Some exercises**:

* **Breathing Exercises**: Engage in slow diaphragmatic breathing with long exhales, to stimulate the vagus nerve long exhales to promote relaxation.

* **Vocal Toning**: Use gentle vocalizations, humming, or chanting. The vibrations from vocalizations can stimulate the vagus nerve.

* **Face and Neck Stretches**: Gently stretch and release tension in the muscles of the face and neck, which are connected to the vagus nerve.

* **Social Engagement**: Engage in positive social interactions, whether in person or virtually. Meaningful connections with others can activate the ventral vagal complex.

* **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques**: Practice mindfulness and grounding exercises to bring attention to the present.

* **Gargling**: Gargling with water may stimulate the vagus nerve, as it involves the muscles connected to the vagus nerve.

* **Laughter and Play**: Engage in activities that bring joy. Positive emotions can activate the ventral vagal complex.

* **Physical Exercise**: Regular physical activity, especially activities like yoga, improves vagal tone and well-being.

* **Self-Soothing Touch**: Gentle self-soothing touch, such as placing a hand on your chest or abdomen, can promote a sense of comfort.

* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups, promoting overall relaxation.
