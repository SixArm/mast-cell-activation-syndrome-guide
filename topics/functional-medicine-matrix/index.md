# Functional medicine matrix

The functional medicine matrix is a framework for organizing and evaluating a patient's health history, symptoms, and clinical findings within a comprehensive and holistic context. The functional medicine matrix consists of six key areas, known as the "Seven Core Clinical Imbalances".

**Areas**:

* **Assimilation**: Focuses on the processes of digestion, absorption, and elimination within the gastrointestinal system. It considers factors such as diet, nutrient absorption, gut microbiome health, and digestive enzyme function.

* **Defense and Repair**: Focuses on the body's immune system, which is responsible for defending against infections, toxins, and other harmful agents, as well as repairing damaged tissues. It examines factors such as inflammation, immune function, allergies, and autoimmune conditions.

* **Energy**: Focuses on energy production and utilization, including metabolism, mitochondrial function, hormone balance, and adrenal function. It considers factors such as blood sugar regulation, thyroid health, and stress response.

* **Transport**: Focuses on the circulatory system, which transports nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and other substances throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems. It examines factors such as cardiovascular health, blood pressure regulation, and blood vessel function.

* **Biological Rhythms**: Focuses on the body's natural rhythms and cycles, including sleep-wake cycles, hormonal rhythms, and circadian rhythms. It considers factors such as sleep quality, melatonin production, and stress management.

* **Communication**: Focuses on the body's signaling pathways, including neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that coordinate communication between cells, tissues, and organ systems. It examines factors such as neurotransmitter balance, hormone signaling, and neuroendocrine function.
