# Functional medicine matrix

The functional medicine matrix is a key tool used in the practice of functional medicine, a systems-oriented approach to healthcare that aims to address the root causes of disease and promote optimal health and wellness. Developed by the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM), the functional medicine matrix provides a framework for organizing and evaluating a patient's health history, symptoms, and clinical findings within a comprehensive and holistic context.

The functional medicine matrix consists of six key areas, known as the "Seven Core Clinical Imbalances," which are interconnected and influence one another. These areas include:

* **Assimilation**: This area focuses on the processes of digestion, absorption, and elimination within the gastrointestinal system. It considers factors such as diet, nutrient absorption, gut microbiome health, and digestive enzyme function.

* **Defense and Repair**: This area pertains to the body's immune system, which is responsible for defending against infections, toxins, and other harmful agents, as well as repairing damaged tissues. It examines factors such as inflammation, immune function, allergies, and autoimmune conditions.

* **Energy**: This area addresses the body's energy production and utilization processes, including metabolism, mitochondrial function, hormone balance, and adrenal function. It considers factors such as blood sugar regulation, thyroid health, and stress response.

* **Transport**: This area encompasses the circulatory system, which transports nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and other substances throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems. It examines factors such as cardiovascular health, blood pressure regulation, and blood vessel function.

* **Biological Rhythms**: This area focuses on the body's natural rhythms and cycles, including sleep-wake cycles, hormonal rhythms, and circadian rhythms. It considers factors such as sleep quality, melatonin production, and stress management.

* **Communication**: This area pertains to the body's signaling pathways, including neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that coordinate communication between cells, tissues, and organ systems. It examines factors such as neurotransmitter balance, hormone signaling, and neuroendocrine function.

Within each area of the functional medicine matrix, healthcare practitioners evaluate and address specific imbalances, dysfunctions, or disruptions that may contribute to a patient's health concerns. By considering the interconnectedness of these factors and their underlying root causes, functional medicine practitioners aim to develop personalized treatment plans that address the individual needs of each patient and support the body's innate ability to heal and maintain health.

The functional medicine matrix serves as a guide for both assessment and treatment, helping practitioners to identify underlying imbalances, prioritize interventions, and monitor progress over time. It encourages a comprehensive and integrative approach to healthcare that considers the whole person and seeks to address the underlying causes of disease, rather than simply treating symptoms.
