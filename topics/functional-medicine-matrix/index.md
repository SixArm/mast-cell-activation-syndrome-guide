# Functional medicine matrix

The functional medicine matrix is a framework for organizing and evaluating a patient's health history, symptoms, and clinical findings within six key areas, known as the "Seven Core Clinical Imbalances".

**Areas**:

* **Assimilation**: Focus on digestion, absorption, and elimination within the gastrointestinal system. Consider diet, nutrient absorption, gut microbiome health, and digestive enzyme function.

* **Defense and Repair**: Focus on the immune system, which defends against infections, toxins, and other harmful agents, as well as repairing damaged tissues. Consider inflammation, immune function, allergies, and autoimmune conditions.

* **Energy**: Focus on metabolism, mitochondrial function, hormone balance, and adrenal function. Consider blood sugar regulation, thyroid health, and stress response.

* **Transport**: Focus on the circulatory system, which transports nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and other substances throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems. Consider cardiovascular health and lymph health.

* **Biological Rhythms**: Focus on the body's natural rhythms and cycles, including sleep-wake cycles, hormonal rhythms, and circadian rhythms. Consider factors such as sleep quality, melatonin production, and stress management.

* **Communication**: Focus on signaling pathways, including neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that coordinate communication between cells, tissues, and organ systems. Consider neurotransmitter balance, hormone signaling, and neuroendocrine function.
