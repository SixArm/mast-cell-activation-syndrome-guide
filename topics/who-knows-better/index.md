# Who knows better?

"Commit to eating better over the next month and I guarantee you will feel fine." - Sure I've been on a medical diet for eight years and I've got MCAS, POTS, dystonia in my back and neck, complex migraines with right sided facial spasms, but sure, food will fix it.

"That's not a migraine. They only happen on one side of your face and if your pain was a 10 that would be like someone chopping your leg off." - Well you tell me what my pain is then because I just begged my fiance in the car to cut my head off so I could get some relief. My brain feels swollen and if I cry or throw up it makes it feel like it's about to pop out of my eye sockets.

“I hate doctors who tell their patients about disorders because they’ll just look them up and give themselves symptoms” - Talking about the Mayo Clinic specialist who said I should get tested for MCAS because of my blood pressure drops and anaphylactic reactions.

“Your symptoms are not of concern.” - She asked for my top 3 symptoms, and I said dysmotility, gastroparesis, neuropathy, and excessive thirst to the point of not being able to sleep more than 90 minutes.

In my 20’s a rheumatologist sent me away because I was “too young to be here.” In my 30's an immunologist sent me away because “it’s not lupus so I don’t know what you want to hear.”

Had a hematologist tell me that the rheumatologist I was going to see will laugh at me because "We don't really believe in this."

"You have body image issues." The doctor sent me home from the hospital while my legs were 4 times their size, weighing 7kg more than 24h prior, with purple-blue skin that was visibly lacerating.

"You just have bad periods." when I was having allergic reactions to PMS and the only help was antihistamines.

"All your blood work is perfect so you’re good to go." - While nothing was accomplished with any of my issues.
