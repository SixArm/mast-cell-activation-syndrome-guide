# Late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) level test

The late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) level test is a non-invasive diagnostic tool used to evaluate cortisol production by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is a hormone that follows a diurnal rhythm, peaking in the early morning and reaching its lowest levels late at night. Measuring cortisol levels in the late evening helps assess the proper functioning of this rhythm, which can be crucial in diagnosing disorders like Cushing's syndrome.

Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excessive cortisol production, often due to tumors in the adrenal or pituitary glands. Elevated LNSC levels can be an early indicator of this condition, as individuals with Cushing's syndrome may have abnormally high cortisol levels at night, disrupting the typical diurnal pattern. The LNSC test involves collecting a saliva sample late at night, typically between 11 p.m. and midnight, when cortisol levels should be at their lowest.

The test is favored for its convenience and non-invasive nature, as it can be performed at home without the need for a clinical setting or blood draws. Patients collect their saliva sample using a simple kit and send it to a laboratory for analysis. This ease of use increases patient compliance and provides accurate and reliable results.

LNSC testing is particularly useful in the initial screening for Cushing's syndrome, and abnormal results often prompt further confirmatory tests. It is also used to monitor cortisol levels in patients undergoing treatment for hypercortisolism. By providing critical insights into cortisol production patterns, the LNSC test plays a vital role in the effective diagnosis and management of adrenal gland disorders.
