# Sleep hygiene

Sleep hygiene refers to a set of practices and habits that promote good sleep quality and help individuals achieve restful and rejuvenating sleep.

**Key principles**:

* **Use the Bed Only for Sleep and Intimacy**: Avoid using your bed for activities like watching TV, working, or using electronic devices.

* **Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment**: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.

* **Watch Your Diet**: Finish eating at least two hours before bed.

* **Mind What You Drink**: Reduce your liquid intake in the evening.

* **Limit Screens**: Avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.

* **Establish a Bedtime Routine**: Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading, bathing, or meditating.

* **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the hours leading up to bedtime.

* **Get Regular Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity, but avoid intense exercise close to bedtime.

* **Manage Stress**: Practice stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga.

* **Limit Naps**: If you nap during the day, keep them short (20-30 minutes) and earlier in the day.

* **Control Exposure to Sunlight**: Sunlight exposure in the morning can help regulate your body's sleep-wake cycle.

* **Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
