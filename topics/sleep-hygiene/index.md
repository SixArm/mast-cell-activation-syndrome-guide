# Sleep hygiene

Sleep hygiene refers to a set of practices and habits that promote good sleep quality and help individuals achieve restful and rejuvenating sleep. Following these practices can improve your overall sleep patterns, reduce the risk of sleep disturbances, and contribute to better physical and mental health.

**Key principles**:

* **Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. 
  
* **Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment**: Ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.
  
* **Limit Exposure to Screens**: Avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime because screen light can interfere with the sleep hormone melatonin. 
  
* **Establish a Bedtime Routine**: Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing.

* **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the hours leading up to bedtime.

* **Watch Your Diet**: Finish eating at at least two before bed. Large meals or spicy foods can interrupt sleep.

* **Get Regular Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity, but avoid intense exercise close to bedtime.
  
* **Manage Stress**: Practice stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga.

* **Limit Naps**: If you nap during the day, keep them short (20-30 minutes) and earlier in the day.

* **Mind What You Drink**: Reduce your liquid intake in the evening to minimize nighttime bathroom trips.

* **Control Exposure to Sunlight**: Sunlight exposure in the morning can help regulate your body's sleep-wake cycle. 
  
* **Limit Clock-Watching**: Constantly checking the time can increase stress and anxiety.

* **Use the Bed Only for Sleep and Intimacy**: Avoid using your bed for activities like watching TV, working, or using electronic devices.
