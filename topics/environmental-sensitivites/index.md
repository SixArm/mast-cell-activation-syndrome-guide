# Environmental sensitivities

Environmental sensitivities refer to adverse reactions that individuals may experience in response to exposure to various environmental factors. These sensitivities cause symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, itching, and respiratory issues, and can cause severe symptoms including anaphylaxis.

**Common types:**

* **Sensitivity to Air Quality:** Examples are airborne particles, such as allergens, plant pollens, mold spores, dust, mites, pet dander, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from household products or cooking.

* **Sensitivities to Water Quality:** Examples are dissolved chlorine or bleach, certain cleaners and detergents, and certain water chemicals.

* **Sensitivity to Building Quality:** Examples are carpet outgassing chemicals, industrial cleaning agents, furniture fabric treatments, paint fumes, and sick building syndrome.

* **Sensitivity to Temperature:** Examples are extreme temperatures, whether hot or cold, such as a hot shower or cold bath, or being outside in hot or cold weather.

* **Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS):** EHS is characterized by symptoms that individuals attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from sources like electronic devices, Wi-Fi, and power lines.
