# Fludrocortisone

Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid medication that is used for its mineralocorticoid properties.

**Key points**:

* **Action**: It is a synthetic analog of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It primarily exerts its effects on mineralocorticoid receptors, regulating electrolyte and fluid balance in the body.

**Indications**: It is primarily used in conditions where increased levels of aldosterone are needed. It is often prescribed for [adrenal insufficiency](../adrenal-insufficiency/) and [Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)](../congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia/)

**Mineralocorticoid Effects**: The mineralocorticoid effects of fludrocortisone include promoting sodium retention and potassium excretion, helping to maintain blood pressure and electrolyte balance.

**Administration**: The dosage is individual dependent. It is usually taken orally as a tablet.

**Side Effects**: May include fluid retention, swelling, increased blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalances. Prolonged use or high doses may lead to other corticosteroid-related side effects.

**Discontinuation**: Do not to stop taking fludrocortisone suddenly, as this can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Changes in dosage should be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
