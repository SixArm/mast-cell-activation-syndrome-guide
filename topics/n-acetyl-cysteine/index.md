# N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a dietary supplement that is a form of the amino acid cysteine. NAC is known for its antioxidant properties and its role in supporting several bodily functions.

NAC is generally considered safe when used at recommended doses, but it can cause side effects in some individuals, such as gastrointestinal symptoms or allergic reactions.

**Key points**:

* **Antioxidant Support**: NAC is a precursor to glutathione, one of the body's most important antioxidants. It helps protect cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals.

* **Respiratory Health**: NAC is often used as a mucolytic agent to help loosen and thin mucus in the respiratory tract. It can treat conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis.

* **Liver Health**: NAC may support liver health by promoting detoxification and reducing the toxic effects of certain drugs and toxins on the liver.

* **Mental Health**: There is some research suggesting that NAC may have a role in managing symptoms of psychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and some forms of depression.

* **Acetaminophen Overdose**: NAC is used as an antidote for acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose, as it can help protect the liver from the toxic effects of this common pain reliever.

* **Immune System Support**: NAC has been investigated for its potential to enhance the immune system and reduce the severity and duration of respiratory infections, including the common cold and flu.
