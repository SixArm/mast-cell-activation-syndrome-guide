# Shop for makeup

Makeup recommended by mast cell people. Try to read ingredients lists carefully.
Smaller brands typically tend to be better for those with allergies. Seek
hypoallergenic, gluten free, dye free, fragrance free, bismuth free, and vegan.
Avoid parabans, petroleums, sulphates such as sodium laurel sulfate,
citrus-related ingredients such as citric acid, preservatives such as
formaldehyde, or other additives such as colors or scents or preservatives.
Waterproof makeup may contain petroleum products that bother the eyes..

I can't do aloe now, which limits a lot more of their products than it used to (so I love their shampoos and conditioners but can't do them anymore), but I better tolerate Pacifica's eye shadow than most other brands:
