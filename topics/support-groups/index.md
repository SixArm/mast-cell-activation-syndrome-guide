# Support groups

A serious medical condition can have significant impact on a person's health and quality of life. Support groups can be valuable resources for individuals, as they provide a platform for sharing experiences, seeking advice, and finding emotional support from others.

Here are some places to tryâ€¦

* **Online Health Communities:** Websites and platforms like Inspire, HealthUnlocked, and RareConnect host various health communities where people can connect, share information, and find support.

* **Online Forums and Social Media Groups:** Many support groups exist on popular social media platforms and health-related forums, such as Reddit, Facebook, and X.

* **Patient Advocacy Organizations:** Various patient advocacy and rare disease organizations provide support for individuals. Examples include The Mastocytosis Society and the Mast Cell Action Group.

* **Local Meetup Groups:** Check websites like Meetup.com for local support groups or rare disease support groups. These groups often organize in-person meetings.

* **Healthcare Provider Recommendations:** Your healthcare provider may be aware of local or online support groups. They can provide guidance on finding appropriate resources.

* **Social Media Hashtags:** You can use relevant hashtags on social media platforms like X and Threads to connect with others. For example, search for or use hashtags like #MastCell, #MastCellActivationSyndrome, #MCAS, or #RareDisease.
