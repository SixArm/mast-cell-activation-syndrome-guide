# Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) spurious antibodies

[Source](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dx-2023-0032/html)

"The humoral immune system in MCAS often spuriously produces legitimate antibodies in aberrant patterns and also often spuriously produces mimicking and cross-reactive antibodies."

Research suggests "most positive antibody tests in MCAS patients represent detection of clinically insignificant mimicking antibodies. As such, to reduce incorrect diagnoses of antibody-associated diseases (AADs) and inappropriate treatment in MCAS patients, caution is warranted in interpreting positive antibody tests in these patients. Except in clinically urgent/emergent situations, patience in determining the trendline of a positive antibody in an MCAS patient, and more carefully assessing whether the AAD is truly present, is to be preferred."

"Such clinically incongruent test results instead more likely reflect inflammatory effects upon the humoral immune system itself, driving spurious production of (1) abnormally high or low (even absent) titers of “legitimate” antibodies [7] (i.e., the antibodies expected to be produced in true instances of the associated infectious or autoimmune diseases) and/or (2) “mimicking” antibodies, whose variable chains sufficiently resemble those of antibodies produced in true instances of infectious or autoimmune diseases as to register positive on at least some tests but do not reflect the true presence of the associated diseases."
