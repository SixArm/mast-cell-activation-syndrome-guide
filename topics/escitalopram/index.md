# Escitalopram

TODO

Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is the active S-enantiomer of citalopram, which means it is a more refined version, targeting serotonin reuptake more selectively. This specificity often results in fewer side effects and improved efficacy.

Escitalopram works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation, in the brain. It achieves this by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin into presynaptic neurons, making more serotonin available to bind to the postsynaptic receptors. This mechanism helps alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety by enhancing mood and emotional stability.

The medication is typically prescribed for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. The usual starting dose for adults is 10 mg once daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 20 mg per day, depending on the individual's response and tolerance.

Common side effects of escitalopram include nausea, insomnia, fatigue, dry mouth, increased sweating, and sexual dysfunction. Most side effects are mild and often subside after a few weeks of treatment. However, escitalopram, like other SSRIs, carries a warning for an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in young adults under 25. Therefore, close monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential, especially during the initial stages of treatment.

Escitalopram is generally well-tolerated, but it should not be abruptly discontinued due to the risk of withdrawal symptoms, such as dizziness, irritability, and sensory disturbances. Gradual tapering under medical supervision is recommended when stopping the medication.
