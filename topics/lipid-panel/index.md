# Lipid panel

A Lipid Panel is a blood test that measures the levels of specific lipids or fats in the blood, providing critical information about a person's cardiovascular health. This panel is a key tool for assessing the risk of heart disease and guiding the management of lipid disorders and their treatment. Regular monitoring through lipid panels helps track cardiovascular health.

**Key components**:

* **Total Cholesterol**: This measures the overall amount of cholesterol in the blood. While the body needs some cholesterol for building cells and producing hormones, high levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

* **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol**: Often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, LDL cholesterol can build up on the walls of arteries, forming plaques that narrow and harden the arteries. High levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

* **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol**: Known as "good" cholesterol, HDL cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it to the liver for excretion. Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are generally protective against heart disease.

* **Triglycerides**: These are the most common type of fat in the body, stored in fat cells and used for energy. High levels of triglycerides can contribute to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, especially when combined with high LDL cholesterol or low HDL cholesterol levels.
