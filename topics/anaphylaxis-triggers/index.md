# Anaphylaxis triggers

Anaphylaxis has many potential triggers that depend on the person and their allergies:

* **Food Allergens**: Foods like peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, and wheat are common triggers for anaphylaxis.

* **Insect Stings**: Stings from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis.

* **Medications**: Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contrast media used in medical imaging, can trigger anaphylactic reactions.

* **Latex**: Exposure to latex, often found in gloves and medical equipment, can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals.

* **Other Allergens**: Anaphylaxis can also be triggered by other allergens, such as latex, exercise-induced allergens, and allergens found in some occupational settings.
