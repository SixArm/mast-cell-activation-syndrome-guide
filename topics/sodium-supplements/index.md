# Sodium supplements

Sodium supplements are dietary supplements that contain sodium. Sodium is an essential mineral and electrolyte necessary for the body to maintain fluid balance, regulate blood pressure, transmit nerve impulses, and support muscle function.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: Sodium supplements are typically used to help replenish sodium levels in individuals who have low sodium levels due to factors such as excessive sweating, dehydration, diarrhea, vomiting, or certain medical conditions (such as adrenal insufficiency or kidney disorders).

* **Forms**: Sodium supplements are available in various forms, including sodium chloride (table salt), sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, and sodium phosphate.

* **Dosage**: The recommended dosage of sodium supplements depends on factors such as age, sex, health status, dietary intake, and the underlying cause of sodium deficiency.

* **Indications**: For individuals with sodium deficiency due to factors such as excessive sodium loss, dehydration, or certain medical conditions that affect sodium balance.

* **Absorption**: Sodium is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the small intestine.

* **Side Effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach upset.

* **Safety and Precautions**: Excessive sodium intake can lead to fluid retention, high blood pressure, and other adverse health effects, particularly in individuals with certain medical conditions (such as hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease).
