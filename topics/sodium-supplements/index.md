# Sodium supplements

Sodium supplements are dietary supplements that contain sodium, an essential mineral and electrolyte necessary for various physiological functions in the body. Sodium plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, regulating blood pressure, transmitting nerve impulses, and supporting muscle function. 

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: Sodium supplements are typically used to help replenish sodium levels in individuals who have low sodium levels due to factors such as excessive sweating, dehydration, diarrhea, vomiting, or certain medical conditions (such as adrenal insufficiency or kidney disorders). Sodium supplements may also be used to help maintain electrolyte balance in individuals who engage in prolonged or intense physical activity, such as athletes or outdoor workers.

* **Forms**: Sodium supplements are available in various forms, including sodium chloride (table salt), sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, and sodium phosphate.

* **Dosage**: The recommended dosage of sodium supplements depends on factors such as age, sex, health status, dietary intake, and the underlying cause of sodium deficiency. 

* **Indications**: Sodium supplements are indicated for individuals with diagnosed sodium deficiency or those at risk of developing sodium deficiency due to factors such as excessive sodium loss, dehydration, or certain medical conditions that affect sodium balance. S
  
* **Absorption**: Sodium is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the small intestine. Absorption rates can be influenced by factors such as stomach acidity, food intake, and the presence of other nutrients.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects of sodium supplements may include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach upset.
  
* **Safety and Precautions**: Excessive sodium intake can lead to fluid retention, high blood pressure, and other adverse health effects, particularly in individuals with certain medical conditions (such as hypertension, heart disease, or kidney disease).
