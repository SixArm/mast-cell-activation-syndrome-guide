# What do you wish you knew when you began?

Most doctors don’t know diddly squat about this disease. 

Diligently figure out what your triggers are by listening to your body and being
disciplined to avoid what it doesn't like. Otherwise this will just drag on and
on and on. Strip down to a bare minimum then slowly add things as your body is
healing.

Doctors don’t seem to like it when I quote studies or articles from medical
journals or books written by experts in the field. They seem to think that makes
me a hypochondriac, instead of an informed patient.

I wish I knew how much topical things that touch or go on your skin can cause
reactions, even internal reactions. Things like hand soap, dish soap, face,
lotion, body, lotion, deodorant, toothpaste, cologne, perfume, etc.

Sometimes your body creates a histamine response to nothing. I've always called
them histamine drops, but some days I'm laying in bed and my hands swell, my
throat itches, and I need to take benadryl. I always tried to find the irritant,
but now know that there isn't always one.

If you believe there is something more be your own advocate! I wish I had
realized how bad I actually was. It took me 3 years to get diagnosed. I was told
it was food intolerances, but allergy testing showed nothing.
