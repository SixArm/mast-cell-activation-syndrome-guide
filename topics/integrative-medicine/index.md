# Integrative medicine

Integrative medicine, also known as integrative healthcare, is an approach to medical practice that combines conventional Western medicine with complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). It emphasizes the importance of addressing the whole person, including their physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual well-being, rather than just treating specific symptoms or diseases

**Key points**:

* **Combining Conventional and Complementary Approaches**: Practitioners use evidence-based conventional medical treatments when appropriate, and also incorporate complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, yoga, massage, and nutritional counseling.

* **Personalized Care**: Integrative medicine takes a holistic approach, recognizing benefits of individualized treatment plans tailored to their specific needs and preferences.

* **Prevention and Lifestyle Modification**: There is an emphasis on preventing illness and promoting healthy lifestyles, including dietary modifications, exercise, stress reduction, and mindfulness practices.

* **Collaborative Care**: Integrative medicine often involves a team-based approach, with healthcare providers from different disciplines working together to provide the best care for the patient.

* **Mind-Body Connection**: Practioners recognize the strong connection between mental and emotional well-being and physical health. Mindfulness, meditation, and other mind-body practices are often used.

* **Patient-Centered Care**: Patients are active participants in their healthcare decisions, and their values, beliefs, and goals are taken into consideration.
