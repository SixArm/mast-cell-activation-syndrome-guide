# Antihistamine types

Antihistamines are available in two main types: first-generation and second-generation. Antihistamines are available in two main durations of action: short-acting and long-acting. Antihistamines are available in two main ways to purchase: over the counter and by prescription.

**Generations**:

* **First-generation antihistamines**: These are older antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton). They are effective but can cause drowsiness as a side effect.

* **Second-generation antihistamines**: These are newer medications, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine (Allegra). They are less likely to cause drowsiness and are often preferred for daytime use.

**Durations**:

* **Short-acting antihistamines**: These may need to be taken multiple times a day.

* **Long-acting antihistamines**: These provide relief for 24 hours.

**Purchases**:

* **Over the counter (OTC)**: This means you can buy them without a prescription.

* **By prescription**: This requires a doctor or equivalent, and is for more-severe conditions or specific medical purposes.
