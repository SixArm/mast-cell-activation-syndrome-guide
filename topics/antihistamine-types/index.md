# Antihistamine types

Antihistamines are available in two main types:

* **First-generation antihistamines**: These are older antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton). They are effective but can cause drowsiness as a side effect.

* **Second-generation antihistamines**: These are newer medications, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine (Allegra). They are less likely to cause drowsiness and are often preferred for daytime use.

Antihistamines are available in two main durations of action:

* Short-acting antihistamines may need to be taken multiple times a day.

* Long-acting antihistamines provide relief for 24 hours.

Antihistamines are available in two main ways:

* Over the counter (OTC) which means you can buy them without a prescription.

* By prescription, typically for more severe allergic conditions or for specific medical purposes.
