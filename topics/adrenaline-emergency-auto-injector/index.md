# Adrenaline emergency auto-injector

An adrenaline emergency auto-injector is a medical device designed to quickly and easily administer a dose of adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) in cases of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Commonly known in the United States by the brand name EpiPen.

**Key points:**

* **Purpose:** The primary purpose of the adrenaline auto-injector is to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as those triggered by certain foods, insect stings, medications, or other allergens.

* **Adrenaline:** Adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) is a hormone and medication that rapidly constricts blood vessels, relaxes smooth muscles in the airways, and increases the heart rate. These effects help counteract the symptoms of anaphylaxis and can be life-saving.

* **Device Design:** The injector is a pen-like device that contains a premeasured dose of adrenaline. It is designed for ease of use in emergency situations, even by individuals who may not have medical training.

* **How to Use:** Remove the safety cap. Placing the needle end against the outer thigh, midway between the hip and knee. Press the device to release the dose. The injection can be given through clothing if necessary.

* **Multiple Doses:** In some cases, more than one dose may be needed. Individuals at risk for anaphylaxis may carry more than one auto-injector, and healthcare professionals may provide guidance on when and how to use additional doses.

* **Emergency Medical Attention:** The use of an adrenaline auto-injector is an emergency measure, and individuals should seek immediate medical attention even after using the device.

* **Expiration Date:** Adrenaline auto-injectors have an expiration date, and it's crucial to check and replace them before they expire. Expired devices may not deliver the correct dose of medication.
