# Famotidine (brand name Pepcid)

Famotidine is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as histamine-2 (H2) blockers. It is commonly used to reduce the production of stomach acid and is prescribed for various gastrointestinal conditions.

Famotidine is available over-the-counter in lower doses for short-term relief of heartburn and acid indigestion. In the United States, see brand name Pepcid.

**Key points:**

* **Action**: Famotidine works by blocking the action of histamine at H2 receptors in the stomach. This reduces the secretion of stomach acid by the cells lining the stomach walls.

* **Indications**: Famotidine is often prescribed to treat Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn. Famotidine is used in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcers (ulcers in the stomach or duodenum), and also Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.

* **Forms**: It is available in various forms, including oral tablets, oral suspension, and intravenous (IV) injection.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects may include headache, dizziness, constipation, or diarrhea. Serious side effects are rare but may include changes in heart rate, confusion, or allergic reactions.

* **Interactions**: Famotidine can interact with certain medications, including antacids and drugs that require stomach acid for absorption. It's important to inform healthcare providers about all medications being taken.
