# Epinastine

Epinastine is an antihistamine medication used to treat symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as itching and redness of the eyes. It belongs to the class of drugs known as H1-receptor antagonists, which work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. Brand names: Alesion, Elestat, Purivist.

Epinastine is available as eye drops and is typically administered directly into the eyes. It is used to provide relief from symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, including itching, burning, redness, and watery eyes.

One of the advantages of epinastine is its rapid onset of action, providing relief from symptoms within minutes of administration. It is also known for its long duration of action, allowing for less frequent dosing compared to some other antihistamine eye drops.

Side effects of epinastine eye drops are generally mild and may include temporary stinging or burning sensation upon administration, as well as temporary blurred vision. Serious side effects are rare but may include eye irritation, allergic reactions, or worsening of symptoms.

Epinastine eye drops are available by prescription and should be used according to the instructions provided by a healthcare professional. It is important to avoid touching the tip of the dropper to prevent contamination and to wait at least 5 minutes before using other eye medications if prescribed.
