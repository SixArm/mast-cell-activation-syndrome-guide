# Bespoke boutiques

Bespoke boutiques are healthcare provider groups that offer individualized specialized care. Some groups offer general services such as for nutrition or wellness, and some groups offer specific services such as histamine targeting or mycotoxin treatments.

If you are considering bespoke boutiques, then this list may help you evaluate them.

1. Ensure that all your providers can prescribe any and all medications to you in your area. This was a problem for many of the groups that I evaluated, because the team wasn't all licensed, and some medications had different laws than others (in the U.S.), and some tests and treatments had to go through third party companies that had delays, errors, lost packages, etc. Ideally have your primary contact be an M.D. or D.O. licensed to practice in your areas.

2. There were a lot of problems with sharing medical data. A majority of doctors that I interview leaked personal protected medical data and meta-data to marketing services. If you see anything at all about cookie tracking, or anything at all in the terms and conditions that say the group or it's services may use your data "aggregated" or "anonymized" or for "advertising" or "marketing" then move on. These issues cause lots of downstream problems with sharing with hospitals and other HIPAA practices which you'll likely want.

3. For testing, the best starters that I found are ISAC molecular blood allergy testing for natural chemicals (e.g. food, plants, venom) and SmartPractice T.R.U.E. skin patch testing for industrial chemicals (e.g. formaldehyde, fragrances, bacitracin ), and if you want genetic testing then the Shoemaker GENIE test which is for research purposes. If the team doesn't commit to being able all three of these three tests, then I would suggest moving on.

4. If the team says they use "functional medicine" then ask them what exactly that means, because there are two different kinds. One kind of focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease-- this doesn't help at all with MCAS because no one yet knows the root cause nor how to treat it. The other kind focuses on helping your functional capabilities, such as being able to make a meal, get good exercise, do your work, take care of yourself, and thrive-- this is great for mast cell patients because there are many treatments that can each contribute to feeling better, regardless of the root cause. Be aware that many bespoke boutiques confuse these two kinds of functional medicine.
