# α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)

α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in pigmentation, inflammation, and appetite regulation. It is produced by the pituitary gland and is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor protein.

**Key points**:

* **Pigmentation**: α-MSH stimulates melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin, hair, and eyes. It promotes the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color.

* **Immunomodulation**: α-MSH can modulate immune cell activity and can reduce inflammation in various tissues.

* **Appetite Regulation**: α-MSH interacts with receptors in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in appetite regulation. It has anorexigenic effects, meaning it can suppress appetite.

* **Thermoregulation**: α-MSH plays a role in thermoregulation by affecting heat dissipation and energy balance in the body.

* **Neuroprotection**: Some studies suggest that α-MSH may have neuroprotective effects and could be explored for potential therapeutic applications in neurological disorders.

* **Sexual Function**: There is evidence to suggest that α-MSH may influence sexual behavior and reproductive functions.
