# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to an imbalance in the production of certain hormones.

**Key points**:

* **Types**: Classic CAH is severe and can result in a life-threatening condition in newborns if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Non-Classic CAH is milder with later-onset symptoms presenting in childhood or adolescence.

* **Symptoms**: Common symptoms include: ambiguous genitalia in females (in severe cases), excessive hair growth (hirsutism), irregular menstrual periods, rapid growth in childhood, salt-wasting and dehydration (in severe cases).

* **Diagnosis**: Newborns are often screened for CAH as part of routine newborn screening. Diagnosis involves measuring hormone levels in blood and urine and genetic testing to identify the specific enzyme deficiency.

* **Treatment**: Treatment aims to replace the deficient hormones and manage symptoms. It may include corticosteroid medications to replace cortisol, or ineralocorticoid medications to replace aldosterone.

* **Management**: Lifelong treatment is typically required. Psychosocial support may be helpful.

* **Genetic Counseling**: Genetic counseling may be recommended for families with a history of CAH to assess the risk of passing the condition to future generations.
