# Vitamin K (phylloquinone)

Vitamin K (also known as phylloquinone) is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in blood clotting (coagulation) and bone metabolism. There are two main forms of vitamin K: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone). 

**Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone)**:

 * **Dietary Source**: Vitamin K1 is primarily found in green leafy vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, and lettuce. It is also present in smaller amounts in other plant foods, such as soybeans, green tea, and certain vegetable oils (e.g., canola oil, soybean oil).

* **Function**: Vitamin K1 is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver, particularly prothrombin (also known as factor II), which is necessary for blood clot formation. 

**Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone)**:

* **Dietary Source**: Vitamin K2 is found in animal products and fermented foods, as well as in smaller amounts in certain plant-based sources. Rich dietary sources of vitamin K2 include fermented foods like natto (a traditional Japanese dish made from fermented soybeans), cheese, egg yolks, and meats.

* **Function**: Vitamin K2 plays a role in bone metabolism by activating osteocalcin, a protein involved in bone mineralization. Adequate vitamin K2 levels are associated with improved bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

**Key points**:
  
* **Recommended dietary allowance**: 90 micrograms (mcg) per day for women and 120 mcg per day for men.

* **Safety**: Vitamin K deficiency is rare but can occur in individuals with malabsorption disorders or liver disease. Symptoms of vitamin K deficiency may include easy bruising, excessive bleeding, and impaired bone health. Vitamin K toxicity is rare and typically occurs with high-dose supplementation; this can interfere with anticoagulant medications and may lead to blood clot formation.
