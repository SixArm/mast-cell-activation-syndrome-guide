# Bioidentical hormones

Bioidentical hormones are compounds that are chemically identical to the hormones produced naturally by the human body. These hormones are often used in [hormone replacement therapy (HRT)](../hormone-replacement-therapy/) to treat symptoms of hormonal imbalances or deficiencies, particularly during menopause or andropause.

Common bioidentical hormones include [estrogen](../estrogen/), [progesterone](../progesterone/), and [testosterone](../testosterone/). They are derived from plant sources, such as soy or yams, and are processed to have the same molecular structure as the hormones produced by the ovaries, testes, or adrenal glands. The goal of bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) is to alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and decreased libido by restoring hormonal balance.

One of the key advantages of bioidentical hormones is their perceived compatibility with the body, potentially leading to fewer side effects compared to synthetic hormones, which may have different chemical structures. Proponents of BHT argue that because bioidentical hormones are structurally identical to endogenous hormones, they are metabolized more naturally by the body, reducing the risk of adverse reactions.

However, the use of bioidentical hormones is not without controversy. While some patients report significant improvements in their symptoms, scientific evidence supporting the superiority of bioidentical hormones over conventional HRT is limited. Additionally, the customization of hormone doses by compounding pharmacies raises concerns about consistency, quality control, and regulatory oversight.
