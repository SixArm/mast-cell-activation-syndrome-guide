# Mediator Release Test (MRT)

The Mediator Release Test (MRT) is a type of blood test used to test your body's reactions to 0ver 170 foods and food additives. It is a patented test from Oxford Biomedical Technologies, Inc. The cost is advertised at $695.

Many of these kinds of tests measure your body’s immune response to a variety of foods by testing the levels of certain antibodies in your blood, such as IgG and IgG4, after you’re exposed to various food antigens.
Yet research suggests that the presence of these antibodies may not be an accurate or reliable marker of food sensitivity, especially because many other antibodies and cell-mediated reactions may also be involved in food sensitivities.

Multiple organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), have advised against using these tests to diagnose food sensitivities.
