# Complement system testing

Complement system testing involves assessing the functionality and levels of proteins within the complement system, a crucial component of the immune system. The complement system consists of a series of proteins that enhance the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Testing can help diagnose complement deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and monitor the activity of certain conditions.

There are several types of complement tests, including total complement activity (CH50 or CH100), which measures the overall activity of the complement system, and individual complement component tests (such as C3 and C4), which measure the levels of specific complement proteins. Low levels or dysfunctional complement proteins can indicate an immune deficiency or an autoimmune condition, such as [systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)](../systemic-lupus-erythematosus/), where the bodyâ€™s immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.

Complement testing is particularly important in diagnosing hereditary angioedema (HAE), a condition caused by a deficiency of C1-inhibitor, a protein that regulates the complement system. Patients with HAE experience recurrent episodes of severe swelling.

Interpretation of complement test results requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation, considering patient history and other diagnostic tests. Elevated complement levels may be seen in acute inflammatory conditions, while decreased levels can indicate chronic autoimmune diseases or genetic deficiencies. Complement system testing is a critical tool for diagnosing and managing various immune-related disorders, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of these diseases.
