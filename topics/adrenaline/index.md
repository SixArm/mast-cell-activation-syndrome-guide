# Adrenaline

Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body's "fight or flight" response to stress or danger. It is produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of each kidney. Adrenaline acts on various target tissues and organs to prepare the body to respond to a perceived threat or stressor.

**Key points**:

* **Increased Blood Flow**: Adrenaline stimulates the heart, and also causes blood vessels to constrict in certain areas, to help blood flow to vital organs and muscles.

* **Dilation of Airways**: Adrenaline causes the bronchi (airways) in the lungs to dilate, allowing for increased airflow.

* **Dilation of Pupils**: Adrenaline causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate (enlarge), improving vision in low-light conditions.

* **Mobilization of Glucose**: Adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver into glucose, to provides immediate energy for the body.

* **Inhibition of Insulin Release**: Adrenaline inhibits the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps glucose availability.

* **Enhanced Mental Alertness**: Adrenaline can improve mental focus and alertness, allowing individuals to quickly assess and respond to situations.

* **Stimulation of Lipolysis**: Adrenaline promotes the breakdown of fat stores (lipolysis) to release fatty acids into the bloodstream, for additional energy.

* **Emergency medication**: In emergency situations, synthetic forms of adrenaline (epinephrine) are sometimes administered as a medication, particularly in cases of severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, or acute asthma attacks.
