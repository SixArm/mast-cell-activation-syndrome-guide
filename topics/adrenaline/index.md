# Adrenaline

Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body's "fight or flight" response to stress or danger. Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal glands on top of each kidney.

**Key points**:

* **Increased Blood Flow**: Adrenaline stimulates the heart and also causes blood vessels to constrict in certain areas, to help blood flow.

* **Dilation of Airways**: Adrenaline causes the bronchi (airways) in the lungs to dilate, allowing for increased airflow.

* **Dilation of Pupils**: Adrenaline causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate (enlarge), improving vision in low-light conditions.

* **Mobilization of Glucose**: Adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver into glucose, to provides immediate energy for the body.

* **Inhibition of Insulin Release**: Adrenaline inhibits the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps glucose availability.

* **Enhanced Mental Alertness**: Adrenaline can improve mental focus and alertness, allowing individuals to quickly assess and respond to situations.

* **Stimulation of Lipolysis**: Adrenaline promotes the breakdown of fat stores (lipolysis) to release fatty acids into the bloodstream, for additional energy.

* **Emergency medication**: Adrenaline is sometimes administered as a medication for severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, or acute asthma attacks.
