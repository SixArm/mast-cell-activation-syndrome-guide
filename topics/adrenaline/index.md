# Adrenaline

Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body's "fight or flight" response to stress or danger. It is produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of each kidney. Adrenaline acts on various target tissues and organs to prepare the body to respond to a perceived threat or stressor.

**Key points:**

* **Increased Heart Rate:** Adrenaline stimulates the heart, leading to an increase in heart rate. This helps pump more blood to the muscles, preparing the body for physical activity.

* **Dilation of Airways:** Adrenaline causes the bronchi (airways) in the lungs to dilate, allowing for increased airflow. This facilitates better oxygen exchange, optimizing the body for increased physical exertion.

* **Dilation of Pupils:** Adrenaline causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate (enlarge). This allows more light to enter the eyes, improving vision in low-light conditions.

* **Increased Blood Flow to Muscles:** Adrenaline redirects blood flow away from less essential functions (such as digestion) and toward the muscles. This helps supply the muscles with oxygen and nutrients, enhancing their ability to respond to physical demands.

* **Mobilization of Glucose:** Adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. This provides an immediate energy source for the body.

* **Inhibition of Insulin Release:** Adrenaline inhibits the release of insulin from the pancreas. This helps prevent excess glucose uptake by cells, ensuring that glucose remains available for energy production during stress.

* **Increased Blood Pressure:** Adrenaline causes blood vessels to constrict in certain areas, leading to an increase in blood pressure. This supports efficient blood flow to vital organs and muscles.

* **Enhanced Mental Alertness:** Adrenaline can improve mental focus and alertness, allowing individuals to quickly assess and respond to a stressful situation.

* **Stimulation of Lipolysis:** Adrenaline promotes the breakdown of fat stores (lipolysis) to release fatty acids into the bloodstream. These fatty acids can be used as an additional energy source.

* **Emergency medication:** In emergency situations, synthetic forms of adrenaline (epinephrine) are sometimes administered as a medication, particularly in cases of severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, or acute asthma attacks.
