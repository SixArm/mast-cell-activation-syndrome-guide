# Mupirocin

Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic widely used to treat bacterial skin
infections, particularly those caused by Gram-positive bacteria like
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. It is especially effective in
managing conditions such as impetigo, folliculitis, and secondary infections of
small skin lesions such as cuts or abrasions. Brand name: Bactroban.

The primary mechanism of action of mupirocin involves the inhibition of
bacterial protein synthesis. Mupirocin achieves this by binding to
isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme critical for the incorporation of the amino
acid isoleucine into bacterial proteins. This binding effectively halts
bacterial growth and replication, leading to the eradication of the infection.

Mupirocin is available in several topical formulations, including ointment and
cream. Typically, the ointment is applied to the affected area up to three times
daily, depending on the severity of the infection. The duration of treatment
usually spans one to two weeks, ensuring complete eradication of the bacteria.
For intranasal use, mupirocin ointment can also be used to eliminate nasal
carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

One of the advantages of mupirocin is its minimal systemic absorption, which
reduces the risk of systemic side effects and drug interactions. However, it is
crucial to use mupirocin as directed by a healthcare provider and to complete
the prescribed course to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.
