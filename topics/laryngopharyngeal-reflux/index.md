# Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a condition where stomach acid and digestive enzymes backflow into the throat and larynx, causing irritation and inflammation. Unlike gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which mainly affects the esophagus, LPR affects the upper airway, leading to symptoms in the throat and voice box. This condition can occur without the typical heartburn associated with GERD, making it more challenging to diagnose.

Common symptoms of LPR include chronic cough, hoarseness, throat clearing, a sensation of a lump in the throat, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. These symptoms arise because the acid and enzymes irritate the sensitive lining of the throat and larynx. Risk factors for LPR include obesity, smoking, certain dietary habits (such as consuming acidic or spicy foods), and anatomical abnormalities affecting the esophageal sphincters.

Managing LPR often involves lifestyle and dietary changes to reduce acid reflux. Recommendations include eating smaller meals, avoiding trigger foods and beverages (like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods), and not eating close to bedtime. Additionally, elevating the head of the bed and losing weight if overweight can help reduce symptoms. In some cases, medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers may be prescribed to decrease stomach acid production. If symptoms persist despite these measures, further evaluation by a healthcare professional is essential to rule out other potential causes and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.
