# Organic acids test (OAT)

The Organic Acids Test (OAT) is a comprehensive diagnostic tool used to assess metabolic function by measuring the levels of organic acids in the urine. These organic acids are byproducts of various metabolic processes within the body and can provide valuable insights into cellular energy production, nutrient deficiencies, detoxification pathways, and gut microbial activity.

The OAT is particularly useful for identifying imbalances that may not be detectable through standard blood tests. It can detect issues such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the presence of harmful bacteria or yeast in the gastrointestinal tract. By analyzing the patterns and concentrations of over 70 organic acids, healthcare providers can gain a detailed understanding of an individual's metabolic state and identify potential areas for therapeutic intervention.

Patients with chronic health conditions such as fatigue, mood disorders, autism, gastrointestinal issues, and unexplained symptoms often benefit from the insights provided by the OAT. For example, high levels of certain organic acids might indicate deficiencies in essential nutrients like vitamins B6, B12, or biotin, which are critical for energy production and neurological health.

The test involves collecting a urine sample, which is then analyzed in a specialized laboratory. Results typically guide personalized treatment plans, including dietary modifications, targeted supplementation, and lifestyle changes to address the identified imbalances.
