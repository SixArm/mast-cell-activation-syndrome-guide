# Functional medicine timeline

The functional medicine timeline is a tool used in functional medicine practice to create a comprehensive overview of a patient's health history, including key events, exposures, and experiences that may have influenced their current health status. Developed by the Institute for Functional Medicine (IFM), the functional medicine timeline helps healthcare practitioners to identify patterns, connections, and underlying factors contributing to a patient's health concerns.

**Components**:

* **Birth and early childhood**: The timeline begins with the patient's birth and early childhood experiences, including details such as birth weight, gestational age, mode of delivery, breastfeeding history, and early milestones. Factors such as maternal health, prenatal exposures, and early childhood illnesses or infections may also be included.

* **Medical history**: The timeline includes a chronological overview of the patient's medical history, including significant illnesses, injuries, surgeries, hospitalizations, and other medical events. This may include diagnoses of chronic conditions, acute illnesses, and major medical interventions.

* **Family history**: Information about the patient's family history is included to identify potential genetic predispositions, hereditary conditions, and patterns of illness or disease within the family. This may include details about the health status of parents, siblings, grandparents, and other close relatives.

* **Lifestyle factors**: The timeline includes information about the patient's lifestyle factors, including dietary patterns, physical activity levels, sleep habits, stressors, and coping strategies. This may also include details about tobacco use, alcohol consumption, recreational drug use, and other lifestyle behaviors.

* **Environmental exposures**: Details about environmental exposures are included to identify potential triggers or contributors to the patient's health concerns. This may include information about occupational exposures, residential exposures (e.g., toxins, pollutants), travel history, and other environmental factors.

* **Psychosocial history**: The timeline includes information about the patient's psychosocial history, including significant life events, relationships, social support networks, educational and occupational history, and emotional well-being. This may also include details about trauma, abuse, or adverse childhood experiences.

* **Dietary history**: Information about the patient's dietary habits, preferences, and patterns of food intake is included to assess nutritional status, identify potential dietary triggers or deficiencies, and guide dietary interventions. This may include details about food allergies, sensitivities, intolerances, and dietary restrictions.

* **Supplement and medication history**: The timeline includes details about the patient's use of supplements, vitamins, herbs, and medications, including dosages, durations of use, and perceived benefits or side effects. This information helps to assess potential interactions, nutrient depletions, and medication-related issues.
