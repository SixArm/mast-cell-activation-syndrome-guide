# Stomach acid test

The stomach acid test, also known as the gastric acid secretion test, measures the amount and acidity of gastric acid produced by the stomach. This test is often used to diagnose conditions related to abnormal stomach acid production, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, achlorhydria, or hypochlorhydria. Understanding the level of stomach acid can help healthcare providers determine the cause of symptoms like indigestion, heartburn, and abdominal pain.

The procedure typically involves inserting a thin, flexible tube through the nose or mouth and into the stomach. This tube is used to collect stomach fluid samples at baseline and after stimulation with a substance like pentagastrin, which prompts the stomach to produce acid. The samples are then analyzed to measure the volume and pH of the gastric acid. In some cases, the test may also include a basal acid output (BAO) and maximal acid output (MAO) measurement to evaluate the stomach's acid-producing capability more comprehensively.

The stomach acid test can provide valuable insights into various gastrointestinal disorders. For instance, low levels of stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) can be indicative of chronic atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia, while high levels (hyperchlorhydria) may suggest Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive acid production due to tumors in the pancreas or duodenum. The results of the test help in tailoring appropriate treatments, such as acid-suppressing medications for hyperchlorhydria or supplemental acid therapy for hypochlorhydria.

While the stomach acid test is informative, it is not commonly performed as a routine diagnostic procedure due to its invasive nature. It is typically reserved for cases where other diagnostic methods, like endoscopy or pH monitoring, have not provided sufficient information. The test must be conducted by a skilled healthcare professional to ensure accuracy and minimize discomfort for the patient.
