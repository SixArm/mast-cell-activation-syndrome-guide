# Bronchospasm treatment

Treatment of bronchospasm typically involves:

* **Bronchodilators**: These medications, such as short-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium), are used to relax the airway smooth muscles and quickly relieve bronchospasm. Long-acting bronchodilators may also be prescribed for long-term management.

* **Anti-inflammatory Medications**: In conditions like asthma, corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) may be used to reduce airway inflammation and prevent bronchospasm.

* **Allergen Avoidance**: For individuals with allergic asthma, identifying and avoiding allergens can help prevent bronchospasm.

* **Lifestyle Modifications**: Managing triggers such as exercise-induced bronchospasm often involves warm-up exercises, using a scarf to breathe in warm, moist air, and staying hydrated.

* **Oxygen Therapy**: In severe cases, supplemental oxygen may be required to ensure adequate oxygen levels in the blood.
