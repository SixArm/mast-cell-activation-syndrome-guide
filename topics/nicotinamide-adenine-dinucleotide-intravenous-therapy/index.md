# Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) intravenous (IV) therapy

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) intravenous (IV) therapy supplies an individual with a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and DNA repair. NAD+ IV therapy has gained attention for its potential benefits. The scientific evidence is still limited. Research is ongoing.

**Key points**:

* **Cellular Function**: NAD+ is involved in various cellular functions, including energy production, DNA repair, and regulation of certain enzymes.

* **Anti-Aging Claims**: Proponents suggest that NAD+ IV therapy may have anti-aging effects due to its role in cellular repair mechanisms and potential impact on mitochondrial function.

* **Neurological Claims**: NAD+ is implicated in neurological health, and there is ongoing research exploring its potential role in conditions like neurodegenerative diseases.

* **Addiction Treatment Claims**: NAD+ IV therapy has been used in some addiction treatment centers as part of detoxification protocols, particularly for individuals recovering from substance use disorders.

* **Safety Considerations**: The safety profile of NAD+ IV therapy is not fully understood, and potential side effects or long-term effects are areas of ongoing research.
