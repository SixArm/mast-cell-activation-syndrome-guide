# Prebiotic supplements

Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike probiotics, which are live microorganisms, prebiotics are non-digestible fibers, carbohydrates, or compounds that serve as a food source for beneficial bacteria.

**Common types:**

* **Inulin and Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)**: These are naturally occurring fibers found in certain fruits, vegetables, and plants.

* **Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)**: GOS are prebiotics found in certain legumes and dairy products.

* **Lactulose**: Lactulose is a synthetic sugar that is not fully absorbed in the small intestine. It reaches the colon.

* **Resistant Starch**: Resistant starch resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon intact. Examples are green bananas and legumes.

* **Pectin**: Pectin is a type of fiber found in fruits, particularly in peels.

**Benefits:**

* **Gut Health**: A healthy balance of gut bacteria is associated with various benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced nutrient absorption, and a strengthened immune system.

* **Fermentation and Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production**: Beneficial bacteria ferment prebiotics in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as byproducts.

* **Metabolism Support**: Prebiotics may have a positive impact on metabolic health, including the regulation of blood sugar levels and lipid metabolism.
