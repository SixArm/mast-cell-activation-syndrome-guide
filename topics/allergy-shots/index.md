# Allergy shots

Allergy shots are a form of treatment for allergies. The shots drops desensitize individuals to specific allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and molds. Allergy shots are also known as subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), and they are an alternative to [allergy drops](../allergy-drops/), also known as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).

**Key points**:

* **Desensitization**: The primary goal of allergy shots is to desensitize the immune system to specific allergens. Over time, the immune system becomes less reactive to these allergens, reducing the severity of allergic reactions when exposed to them.

* **Administration**: Allergy shots are administered by a healthcare provider, typically an allergist or immunologist. The treatment involves receiving injections of allergen extracts in gradually increasing doses over time.

* **Build-up Phase**: The treatment usually begins with a build-up phase, during which the injections are administered more frequently (usually once or twice a week). The dose is gradually increased to reach a maintenance level.

* **Maintenance Phase**: Once the maintenance dose is reached, the frequency of injections is reduced (typically every 2-4 weeks). The maintenance phase can continue for several years.

* **Long-Term Treatment**: Allergy shots are a long-term treatment that typically continues for several years to achieve lasting desensitization. The duration may vary from person to person.

* **Maintenance of Other Treatments**: During the build-up phase, some individuals may need to continue taking allergy medications to manage symptoms. As the desensitization takes effect, medication use can often be reduced.
