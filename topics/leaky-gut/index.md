# Leaky gut

"Leaky gut," or increased intestinal permeability, is a term used to describe a condition where the lining of the gut becomes more porous, allowing substances to pass through that normally would not.

**Key points**:

* **Remove Potential Triggers**: Identify and eliminate foods that contribute to inflammation, such as processed foods, refined sugars, gluten, and dairy. 
  
* **Emphasize Whole Foods**: Focus on a whole foods-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

* **Nutrient-Rich Foods**: Include nutrient-dense foods that support gut health, such as bone broth, fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir), and foods rich in fiber (e.g., vegetables, fruits, whole grains).

* **Prebiotics**: Include prebiotic-rich foods that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Examples include garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, and bananas.

* **Probiotics**: Consider incorporating probiotic-rich foods or supplements to support a healthy balance of gut bacteria.

* **Gut-Supportive Supplements**: Some individuals may consider supplements that are believed to support gut health, such as glutamine, quercetin, aloe vera, and slippery elm.

* **Hydration**: Stay well-hydrated, as water is essential for overall health and helps support the mucosal lining of the gut.

* **Stress Management**: Practice stress-reducing techniques, as chronic stress can impact gut health. Consider activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or mindfulness.

* **Adequate Sleep**: Prioritize quality sleep, as it plays a crucial role in overall health, including immune function and gut health.

* **Physical Activity**: Engage in regular physical activity, as it can support overall health and may positively influence gut health.
