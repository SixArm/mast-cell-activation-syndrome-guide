# Leaky gut

"Leaky gut" is a term used to describe a condition where the lining of the gut becomes more porous, allowing substances to pass through that normally would not. Also known as increased intestinal permeability.

**Key treatments:**

* **Remove Potential Triggers:** Identify and eliminate foods that contribute to inflammation, such as processed foods, refined sugars, gluten, and dairy. 
  
* **Emphasize Good Foods:** Try a whole foods-based diet rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Try foods that support gut health, such as bone broth, fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir), and high-fiber foods.

* **Prebiotics:** Try prebiotic-rich foods that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Examples: garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, bananas.

* **Probiotics:** Try probiotic-rich foods or supplements to support a healthy balance of gut bacteria.
Examples: yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi.

* **Gut-Supportive Supplements:** Try supplements to support gut health. Examples: glutamine, quercetin, aloe vera, slippery elm.

* **Hydration:** This supports the mucosal lining of the gut.

* **Stress Management:** Practice stress-reducing techniques, as chronic stress can impact gut health. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or mindfulness.

* **Adequate Sleep:** Prioritize quality sleep, as it plays a crucial role in overall health, including immune function and gut health.

* **Physical Activity:** Engage in regular physical activity, as it can support overall health and may positively influence gut health.
