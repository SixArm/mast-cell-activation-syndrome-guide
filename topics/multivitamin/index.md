# Multivitamin

A multivitamin is a dietary supplement that contains a combination of essential vitamins and minerals. These supplements are designed to provide a convenient way to ensure that you get the recommended daily intake of various vitamins and minerals, especially when your diet may not provide all the necessary nutrients. Multivitamins come in various formulations, catering to different age groups, genders, and specific nutritional needs.

**Key points:**

* **Nutrient Variety:** Multivitamins typically contain a mix of vitamins and minerals, which can include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, various B vitamins (like B1, B2, B3, B6, B12), and essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and more.

* **Daily Intake:** The composition of multivitamins is often based on recommended daily intakes (RDIs) or dietary reference intakes (DRIs) established by health authorities. The specific amounts and ratios of nutrients can vary between different products.

* **Targeted Formulations:** There are specialized multivitamins designed for specific populations, such as prenatal multivitamins for pregnant women, children's multivitamins, and senior formulas that may take into account age-related nutritional needs.

* **Medical Advice:** Before starting a multivitamin or any dietary supplement, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider. They can help you determine whether you need a supplement, which specific one is appropriate, and whether it may interact with any medications you are taking.

* **Quality Control:** Choose reputable brands and products when selecting a multivitamin. Look for third-party testing or quality certifications to ensure that the supplement contains what it claims and is free from contaminants.
