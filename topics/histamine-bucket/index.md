# Histamine bucket

The "histamine bucket" theory is the idea that each person has a histamine threshold for how much histamine their bodies can tolerate. If the histamine exceeds the threshold, then the "histamine bucket overflows", which causes symptoms.

**Key points:**

* **Cumulative Effect**: The concept of the histamine bucket emphasizes that it's not just the histamine content of a single food item that matters; rather, it's the cumulative effect of histamine from various sources throughout the day that "fill the histamine bucket".

* **Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Enzyme**: The body relies on enzymes like diamine oxidase (DAO) to break down histamine. These enzymes work to "drain the histamine bucket".

* **Individual Variability**: Individuals have different tolerance levels for histamine. Some people may have a larger histamine bucket and can tolerate higher levels, while others may have a smaller histamine bucket and may be more sensitive to lower amounts of histamine.

* **Symptoms**: Symptoms of histamine intolerance can vary but may include headaches, migraines, hives, itching, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea), and respiratory symptoms (such as nasal congestion).

* **Management**: Managing histamine intolerance often involves identifying and avoiding high-histamine foods, addressing any underlying issues affecting DAO function, and working with healthcare professionals to develop an individualized plan.
