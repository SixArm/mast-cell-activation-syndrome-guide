# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), enacted in 1996, is a critical U.S. law designed to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patientâ€™s consent or knowledge. HIPAA establishes national standards for electronic health care transactions and addresses the security and privacy of health data. It aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system while ensuring the confidentiality and security of health information.

One of the key components of HIPAA is the Privacy Rule, which sets standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, also known as protected health information (PHI). The Privacy Rule grants patients significant rights over their health information, including rights to access their medical records, request corrections, and be informed about how their information is used and shared.

Another crucial aspect of HIPAA is the Security Rule, which specifies administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information (e-PHI). This includes measures like access controls, data encryption, and regular security audits to protect against data breaches and cyber threats.

HIPAA also includes provisions for health insurance portability, helping individuals maintain health coverage when they change or lose their jobs. Compliance with HIPAA is mandatory for covered entities, including health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers, as well as their business associates. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties, underscoring the importance of adhering to HIPAA regulations to protect patient privacy and data security.
