# ACDM app

I've completed a patch test testing and it showed I am allergic to nickel, formaldehyde , fragrance, Vitamin E , anesthetics (ester ). Now what ? How do I know if the beauty products such as my favorite foundation, eye cream , perfume etc have these ingredients ? My immunologist uploaded my results into ACDM app but they only have a limited list of products (I wonder if some companies paid for testing to be on this list ). She also suggested I download SkinSafe which allows you to scan the product but you have to pay for access . Did anyone try it ? Did you find it helpful? I get contact dermatitis on my face and neck so trying to eliminate exposure . Thanks .
