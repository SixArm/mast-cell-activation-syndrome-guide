# Allergic rhinitis

Allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, is an allergic reaction that occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air, such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold spores. It's a prevalent condition that affects millions of people.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: Sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy eyes or nose or throat, watering of the eyes.

* **Types**: Seasonal, typically due to outdoor pollen. Perennial, typically due to indoor allergens, such as dust mites, pet dander, or mold.

* **Causes**: Allergic rhinitis is triggered by exposure to allergens, which prompt the immune system to release histamine and other chemicals, leading to inflammation and allergy symptoms.

* **Genetics**: There is a genetic predisposition to allergic diseases.

* **Diagnosis**: [medical history](../medical-history/\) and [physical examination](../physical-examination/).  Skin prick tests or blood tests (specific IgE tests) can identify allergens that trigger symptoms.

* **Treatment**: Identify and avoid allergens. [Antihistamine medications](../antihistamine-medications/)  alleviate symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose. [Corticosteroid](../corticosteroids/) reduce inflammation and symptoms like nasal congestion and sneezing. [Decongestants](../decongestants/) help relieve nasal congestion. Leukotriene receptor antagonists block the action of leukotrienes, chemicals involved in allergic reactions. [Allergy shots](../allergy-shots/) or [allergy drops](../allergy-drops/) can help desensitize the immune system to allergens and reduce symptoms over time. Using saline nasal sprays or a neti pot can help rinse allergens from the nasal passages and reduce symptoms.
