# Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a condition characterized by an abnormally fast heart rate originating above the heart's ventricles. Typically, the heart beats between 60 to 100 times per minute at rest. In SVT, the heart rate can accelerate to over 150 beats per minute, sometimes reaching as high as 250 beats per minute. This rapid heartbeat can start and stop abruptly and may last from a few minutes to several hours.

SVT occurs when the electrical impulses that coordinate heartbeats become irregular. This can be due to various factors, including abnormal electrical pathways in the heart, certain medications, excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption, and stress. Common symptoms of SVT include palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fainting. In some cases, SVT may not cause any noticeable symptoms and can be detected during a routine medical examination.

Diagnosis of SVT typically involves an electrocardiogram (ECG) to record the heart's electrical activity and identify the type of tachycardia. Additional tests, such as Holter monitoring, event recording, or an electrophysiological study, may be used to determine the precise cause and location of the abnormal electrical pathways.

Treatment options for SVT vary depending on the severity and frequency of episodes. They may include lifestyle changes, medications to control heart rate, and procedures such as catheter ablation to destroy the abnormal pathways causing the arrhythmia. In emergency situations, vagal maneuvers or electrical cardioversion may be employed to restore normal heart rhythm. Effective management of SVT helps reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and improve quality of life.
