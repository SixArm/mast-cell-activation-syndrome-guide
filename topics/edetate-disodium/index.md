# Edetate disodium

Edetate disodium, also known as disodium EDTA, is a chelating agent used in
various medical and industrial applications. In medicine, it is primarily
utilized for treating heavy metal poisoning, such as lead or mercury toxicity.
By binding to these metals in the bloodstream, edetate disodium forms stable
complexes that are then excreted from the body via the urine, thereby reducing
the toxic effects of heavy metals.

In clinical settings, edetate disodium is administered intravenously under
strict medical supervision due to its potent chelating properties. The chelation
therapy involves a carefully controlled infusion process to avoid potential side
effects, such as kidney damage, hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), or depletion
of other essential minerals and electrolytes. It is crucial for healthcare
providers to monitor patients closely during treatment to ensure safety and
effectiveness.

Beyond its medical uses, edetate disodium has applications in the pharmaceutical
and food industries as a preservative and stabilizer. It prevents
metal-catalyzed oxidation in products, thereby enhancing shelf life and
maintaining quality. In laboratory settings, it is used to sequester metal ions
in various biochemical assays and experiments.
