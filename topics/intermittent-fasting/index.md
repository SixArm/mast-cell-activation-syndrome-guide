# Intermittent fasting (IF)

Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting. Unlike traditional diets that focus on what to eat, intermittent fasting is more about when to eat.

**Common methods:**

* **16/8r**: 16 hours of fasting, then 8 hours of eating regularly. Also known as the Leangains protocol.

* **5:2**: Each week, do five days eating regularly, and do two non-consecutive days of calorie restriction.

* **Eat-Stop-Eat**: Fast for 24 hours, once or twice a week.

* **Alternate Days**: Alternate between days of regular eating and days of calorie restriction or complete fasting.

* **Warrior Diet**: Eat small amounts of raw fruits and vegetables during the day, then eat one large meal at night.

**Benefits:**

* **Weight Loss**: Fasting can lead to a reduction in calorie intake, which may contribute to weight loss.

* **Improved Metabolic Health**: Fasting may improve insulin sensitivity, blood sugar levels, and other markers of metabolic health.

* **Cellular Repair and Autophagy**: Fasting may stimulate autophagy, a cellular process that involves the removal of damaged cells and components.

* **Heart Health**: Fasting may have positive effects on heart health by improving blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other cardiovascular risk factors.
