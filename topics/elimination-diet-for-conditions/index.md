# Elimination diet for conditions

The purpose of an elimination diet can vary, and it is often used to identify and manage the following conditions:

* **Food Allergies:** For individuals with known or suspected food allergies, an elimination diet can help identify specific allergens and eliminate them from the diet to prevent allergic reactions.

* **Food Sensitivities:** Some individuals may experience symptoms, such as digestive issues, headaches, or skin problems, as a result of food sensitivities. An elimination diet can help pinpoint the trigger foods and alleviate these symptoms.

* **Autoimmune Diseases:** In autoimmune diseases like celiac disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, certain dietary modifications, including elimination of gluten or specific foods, may help manage the condition and reduce symptoms.

* **Gastrointestinal Disorders:** An elimination diet can be used in the management of gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to identify trigger foods and reduce digestive symptoms.

* **Behavioral Issues:** In some cases, behavioral problems in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may be linked to dietary factors. An elimination diet can help identify and manage foods that may exacerbate these issues.
