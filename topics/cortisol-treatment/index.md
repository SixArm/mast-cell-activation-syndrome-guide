Medicines can control cortisol production at the adrenal gland. These include ketoconazole, osilodrostat (Isturisa), mitotane (Lysodren), levoketoconazole (Recorlev), and metyrapone (Metopirone).

Mifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or high blood sugar. Mifepristone does not lower the amount of cortisol the body makes, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on tissues.

For supplements, ask your nutritionist about fish oil and ashwagandha.
