# Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of delivering nutrition directly into the bloodstream when a person is unable to obtain adequate nutrition through oral or enteral (tube feeding) routes. TPN provides all essential nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes, in a sterile, hypertonic solution.

**Key points**:

* **Indications**: TPN is typically used in individuals who cannot tolerate oral or enteral feeding due to conditions such as: severe gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. bowel obstruction), inability to swallow or absorb nutrients, major abdominal surgery or trauma, severe malnutrition.

* **Composition**: TPN solutions are individualized based on the patient's nutritional requirements, medical condition, and metabolic status. The solution typically contains dextrose (carbohydrate source), amino acids (protein source), lipids (fat source), electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements.

* **Delivery**: TPN is administered through a central venous catheter (CVC), which is inserted into a large vein, usually in the chest or arm. This allows the TPN solution to be delivered directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.

* **Complications**: May include catheter-related complications, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), metabolic abnormalities such as imbalances in blood glucose, liver dysfunction over Long-term use,
