# Probiotic supplements

Probiotics are live microorganisms, mainly bacteria and yeast, that confer health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. Probiotic supplements are formulations designed to provide a concentrated source of these beneficial microorganisms. 

**Key points:**

* **Types:** Probiotics can include various strains, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and others. 

* **Live Cultures:** To be effective, probiotics must contain live and viable cultures of microorganisms. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) indicates the quantity of live microorganisms present in a probiotic supplement.

* **Health Benefits:** Probiotics may promote digestive health, supporting the immune system, and contributing to a balanced gut microbiota. Some specific strains have been researched for conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

* **Targeted Formulation**s: Some probiotic supplements are formulated for specific purposes, such as women's health, immune support, or infant health. These formulations may contain strains believed to address particular health needs.

* **Dietary Sources:** Probiotics can also be obtained from certain foods, including yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and other fermented foods.
