# Adrenaline dumping

"Adrenaline dumping" is a colloquial term often used to describe the rapid release of [adrenaline](../adrenaline/) (also known as epinephrine) into the bloodstream. Adrenaline is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the body's "fight or flight" response to stress or danger. When the body perceives a threat, the adrenal glands release adrenaline to prepare the body for quick action.

**Key points:**

* **Fight or Flight Response**: Adrenaline is released in response to stress, whether it be physical or psychological. It prepares the body to respond quickly to a perceived threat by increasing heart rate, dilating airways, redirecting blood flow to major muscle groups, and sharpening senses.

* **Physical Symptoms**: Symptoms can include an increased heart rate, rapid breathing, heightened alertness, sweating, and dilated pupils.

* **Triggers**: Triggers can include a sudden loud noise, a perceived threat, an intense emotional experience, or physical exertion.

* **Duration**: The effects of adrenaline are usually short-lived, and the body returns to its normal state once the perceived threat or stressor is no longer present.

* **Chronic Stress**: Chronic or repeated activation of the stress response can have negative effects on long-term health.

* **Management**: Managing stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, regular exercise, and adequate sleep can help.

* **Medical Conditions**: Conditions such as panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and certain anxiety disorders may involve an abnormal release of adrenaline.
