# Histamine intolerance: diagnosis

Diagnosing histamine intolerance can be challenging, as there are no specific tests to confirm the condition. It is typically diagnosed based on a person's [medical history](../medical-history/\), symptoms, and the response to dietary modifications.

In some cases, healthcare providers may use a food diary to track symptom triggers and evaluate the response to a low-histamine diet.
