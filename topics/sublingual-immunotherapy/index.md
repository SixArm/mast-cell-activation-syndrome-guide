# Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a method of treating allergies by placing allergen extracts under the tongue. This approach is designed to build tolerance to specific allergens, reducing symptoms over time. SLIT is particularly popular for managing allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, and allergies to dust mites, pollen, and certain foods.

SLIT involves administering small, gradually increasing doses of the allergen extract in tablet or liquid form. Patients typically begin treatment with a low dose, which is increased over several weeks to a maintenance level. The allergen is placed under the tongue, where it is absorbed through the mucous membranes and interacts with the immune system to promote tolerance.

One of the major advantages of SLIT is its convenience and ease of use. Unlike traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), which requires injections at a healthcare provider's office, SLIT can be self-administered at home. This increases patient compliance and reduces the time and cost associated with frequent medical visits.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that SLIT is effective in reducing symptoms and the need for medication in allergic individuals. It is generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being mild and localized, such as itching or swelling in the mouth. Serious allergic reactions are rare but can occur, so patients should be educated on recognizing and responding to potential adverse effects.
