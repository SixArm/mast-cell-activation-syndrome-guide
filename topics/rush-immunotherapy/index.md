# Rush immunotherapy

TODO

Rush immunotherapy, also known as Rapid Desensitization Immunotherapy (RDI), is an accelerated form of allergy treatment designed to quickly build up a patient's tolerance to specific allergens. Unlike traditional allergen immunotherapy, which gradually increases allergen doses over several months to years, RUSH immunotherapy condenses this process into a much shorter timeframe, often within a few days.

The process involves administering increasing doses of the allergen at regular intervals under close medical supervision. This rapid escalation helps the patient's immune system adjust to the allergen more quickly, thereby reducing the duration of the initial buildup phase. RUSH immunotherapy is typically performed in a controlled clinical setting to monitor and manage any potential adverse reactions, such as allergic responses or anaphylaxis.

RUSH immunotherapy is particularly beneficial for patients with severe allergies who need rapid relief, such as those with life-threatening reactions to insect stings or severe environmental allergies. It is also useful for individuals who have difficulty adhering to the prolonged schedules of traditional immunotherapy.

Despite its advantages, RUSH immunotherapy carries a higher risk of allergic reactions compared to the standard approach. Therefore, it requires careful patient selection and thorough monitoring by experienced healthcare professionals. Pre-treatment with medications such as antihistamines or corticosteroids may be used to minimize the risk of severe reactions.

Overall, RUSH immunotherapy offers a faster route to allergy desensitization, providing significant benefits for patients in need of rapid symptom relief. With proper management and medical oversight, it can be a safe and effective alternative to traditional immunotherapy methods.
