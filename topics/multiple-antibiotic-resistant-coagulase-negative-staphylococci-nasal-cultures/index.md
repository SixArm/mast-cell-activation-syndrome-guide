# Multiple Antibiotic Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (MARCoNS): nasal cultures

Multiple Antibiotic Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (MARCoNS) refers to a type of bacteria that is coagulase-negative and often resistant to multiple antibiotics. MARCoNS is commonly associated with chronic sinus infections and is sometimes identified through nasal cultures.

**Key points**:

* **Nasal Cultures**: Nasal cultures involve taking samples from the nasal passages to identify the presence of bacteria. Cultures can be helpful in diagnosing infections and determining the most appropriate treatment.

* **Association with Chronic Sinus Infections**: MARCoNS are often implicated in cases of chronic sinus infections. These infections can be challenging to treat, and MARCoNS are known for their resistance to multiple antibiotics.

* **Treatment Challenges**: MARCoNS are notorious for their resistance to antibiotics, making treatment challenging. In some cases, healthcare providers may use targeted antibiotic therapy based on sensitivity testing, but resistance can still be an issue.

* **Biofilm Formation**: Staphylococci, including MARCoNS, are capable of forming biofilms. Biofilms are protective structures that bacteria create, making them more resistant to antibiotics and the immune system. Biofilm formation can contribute to persistent infections.

* **Integrated Treatment Approaches**: Addressing MARCoNS infections often involves an integrated approach. This may include not only antibiotic therapy but also measures to disrupt biofilms, improve the immune response, and address underlying factors contributing to chronic infections.
