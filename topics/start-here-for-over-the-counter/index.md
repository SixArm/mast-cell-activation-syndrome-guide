# Start here for over-the-counter help

If you're sick and you want to consider over-the-counter medications, then ask your healthcare provider about this plan as a starting point. Mast cell patients suggest the steps below.

**Morning: [famotidine (brand name Pepcid)](../famotidine/)**

* This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as second-generation histamine-2 (H2) blockers. If you can't find it, then consider any medication from the same class.

**Evening: [levocetirizine (brand name Xyzal)](../levocetirizine/)**

* This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as second-generation histamine-1 (H1) blockers. If you can't find it, then consider any medication rom the same class.

**Rescue: [diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl)](../diphenhydramine/)**
  
* This medication is to rescue yourself from strong symptoms. It has side effects such as drowsiness. Be aware that some brands contain artificial colors, and these may trigger people, so ask for colorless versions of the medication. 
  
* If your symptoms are severe, then call an ambulance, or go immediately to a hospital, or seek emergency medical help.

**Mealtime: [diamine oxidase supplements](../diamine-oxidase-suppplements/)**

* Thirty minutes before each meal, take a diamine oxidase (DAO) supplement. DAO is an enzyme in the body that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of histamine. 
  
* Eat a low-histamine diet, to reduce the amount of histamine in your body, thus reduce severity of histamine reactions.

* Some people like to take more supplements, such as electrolytes, quercetin, vitamins, minerals, and herbs.
