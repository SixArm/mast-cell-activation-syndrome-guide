**Morning [famotidine (brand name Pepcid)](../famotidine/)**: This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as second-generation histamine-2 (H2) blockers. If you can't find it, then consider any medication from the same class.

**Evening [levocetirizine (brand name Xyzal)](../levocetirizine/)**: This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as second-generation histamine-1 (H1) blockers. If you can't find it, then consider any medication rom the same class.

**Rescue [diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl)](../diphenhydramine/)**: This medication is to rescue yourself from strong symptoms. It has side effects such as drowsiness and should not be taken long term. Be aware that some brands contain artificial colors, and these may trigger people, so ask your pharmacist for colorless versions.
  
**Mealtime [dietary supplements](../dietary-supplements/)**: Thirty minutes before eating, take [diamine oxidase supplements](../diamine-oxidase-suppplements/), [vitamin C](../vitamin-c/), and [omega-3].
