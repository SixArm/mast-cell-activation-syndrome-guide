# Zeolite supplements

Zeolite supplements support detoxification and overall health by providing zeolites. Zeolites are naturally occurring volcanic minerals characterized by their porous structure. Zeolites can trap and remove toxins and heavy metals from the body.

The microporous structure of zeolites allows them to act as molecular sieves, capturing and binding heavy metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium. This process helps to cleanse the body of harmful substances, supporting liver and kidney function, and promoting overall detoxification.

Zeolites are also known for their ability to help balance pH levels in the body. By neutralizing excess acidity, zeolite supplements can contribute to improved metabolic function and a healthier internal environment. This pH balancing effect may also enhance nutrient absorption and immune system performance.

Zeolites also exhibit antioxidant properties, helping to protect cells from oxidative stress and free radical damage. This can support cellular health and may contribute to anti-aging benefits, as well as improved vitality and energy levels.

Furthermore, some studies suggest that zeolite supplements can aid in gastrointestinal health by promoting a balanced gut microbiome and improving digestive function. This can lead to better nutrient absorption and reduced gastrointestinal discomfort.
