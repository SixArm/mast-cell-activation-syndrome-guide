# Hormones

Hormones are chemical messengers produced by glands in the endocrine system that regulate various physiological processes in the body. They travel through the bloodstream to tissues and organs, influencing functions such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, mood, and homeostasis.

[Insulin](../insulin/) is produced by the pancreas. Insulin helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells for energy production. Dysfunction in insulin production or action can lead to diabetes, a chronic condition requiring careful management.

[Thyroxine](../thyroxine/) is produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroxine plays a vital role in regulating metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature. Imbalances in thyroxine levels can result in conditions such as hypothyroidism, characterized by fatigue and weight gain, or hyperthyroidism, marked by weight loss and nervousness.

[Cortisol](../cortisol/) is produced by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is a stress hormone that helps the body respond to stress by increasing blood sugar levels, enhancing brain function, and suppressing non-essential bodily functions. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels can lead to various health issues, including hypertension and immune system suppression.

Sex hormones, including [estrogen](../estrogen/), [progesterone](../progesterone/), and [testosterone](../testosterone/), are essential for reproductive health and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogen and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle and support pregnancy, while testosterone is key for male reproductive development and maintaining muscle mass and bone density in both sexes.
