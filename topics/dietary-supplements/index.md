# Dietary supplements

Dietary supplements are products designed to provide nutrients that help a person's health. Dietary supplements are available in various forms, such as pills, capsules, powders, liquids, and gummies.

**Overview:**

* **Vitamins:** These are essential organic compounds that your body needs to function properly. Examples are vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and the B-complex vitamins.

* **Minerals:** These are inorganic elements that are vital for bodily functions. Examples are calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.

* **Amino Acids:** These are the building blocks of proteins. Some amino acids are considered essential because the body cannot produce them, so they must be obtained from the diet.

* **Herbs and Botanicals:** Many plants and plant extracts have health benefits. Examples include ginseng, echinacea, and turmeric.

* **Enzymes:** These are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions in the body. Digestive enzymes, for example, help break down food.

* **Probiotics:** These are beneficial bacteria that support a healthy gut microbiome and digestive health.

* **Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** These are often taken for their potential cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory benefits.

* **Dietary Fiber:** Fiber supplements are used to increase fiber intake, which can aid in digestion and promote a feeling of fullness.

* **Specialty Supplements:** Some specialty supplements focus on sports performance, or joint health, or cognitive function, or skin health, or other areas.
