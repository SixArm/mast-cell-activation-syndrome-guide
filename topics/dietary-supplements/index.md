# Dietary supplements

Dietary supplements are products designed to provide nutrients that help a person's health. Dietary supplements are available in various forms, such as pills, capsules, powders, liquids, and gummies.

Overview:

* Vitamins: These are essential organic compounds that your body needs in small amounts to function properly. Common vitamins include vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and the B-complex vitamins.

* Minerals: These are inorganic elements that are vital for various bodily functions. Common minerals include calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.

* Amino Acids: These are the building blocks of proteins. Some amino acids are considered essential because the body cannot produce them, so they must be obtained from the diet or supplements.

* Herbs and Botanicals: Many plants and plant extracts have health benefits. Examples include ginseng, echinacea, and turmeric.

* Enzymes: These are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions in the body. Digestive enzymes, for example, help break down food.

* Probiotics: These are beneficial bacteria that support a healthy gut microbiome and may have various health benefits, particularly for digestive health.

* Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids: These are often taken for their potential cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory benefits.

* Dietary Fiber: Fiber supplements are used to increase fiber intake, which can aid in digestion and promote a feeling of fullness.

* Specialty Supplements: There are many other specialized dietary supplements, such as those marketed for sports performance, joint health, cognitive function, and skin health, among others.
