# Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition characterized by an excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestine, where normally, relatively few bacteria reside compared to the large intestine. This overgrowth can disrupt normal digestive processes and lead to a variety of symptoms and complications.

Common symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malabsorption of nutrients, which can result in weight loss and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. SIBO can also cause steatorrhea (fatty stools) due to impaired fat absorption. The condition is often associated with underlying issues such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, and conditions that affect intestinal motility.

Diagnosis of SIBO is typically made through breath tests that measure the levels of hydrogen and methane produced by bacteria in the small intestine after ingestion of a sugar solution. Elevated levels of these gases indicate bacterial overgrowth. In some cases, a direct culture of small intestinal fluid obtained via endoscopy may be performed for diagnosis.

Treatment for SIBO usually involves a combination of antibiotics to reduce bacterial overgrowth, dietary changes to manage symptoms and support gut health, and addressing any underlying conditions contributing to the problem. Commonly used antibiotics include rifaximin and metronidazole.
