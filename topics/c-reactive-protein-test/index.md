# C-reactive protein test

TODO

The C-reactive protein (CRP) test is a blood test used to measure the level of CRP, a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Elevated CRP levels can indicate inflammation in the body, which may be due to a variety of conditions, including infections, chronic diseases, and autoimmune disorders.

CRP is an acute-phase reactant, meaning its levels rise quickly in response to inflammation or infection. This makes the CRP test useful in detecting acute inflammatory conditions such as bacterial infections, including sepsis, and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. It can also help monitor the effectiveness of treatment for these conditions.

In addition to identifying acute inflammation, the CRP test is often used in assessing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Elevated CRP levels have been associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, making the test a valuable tool in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

The CRP test involves a simple blood draw, and the results are typically reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are usually below 3 mg/L. Levels between 3 and 10 mg/L may indicate moderate inflammation, while levels above 10 mg/L suggest significant inflammation or infection that warrants further investigation.

It is important to note that the CRP test is nonspecific, meaning it does not identify the exact cause of inflammation. Therefore, elevated CRP levels require additional tests and clinical evaluation to determine the underlying condition.

In summary, the CRP test is a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring inflammation in the body. Its use ranges from identifying acute infections to assessing chronic inflammatory conditions and evaluating cardiovascular risk. Proper interpretation by a healthcare provider is essential to determine the cause of elevated CRP levels and guide appropriate treatment.
