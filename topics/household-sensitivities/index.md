# Household sensitivities

Household sensitivities refer to adverse reactions or sensitivities that individuals may experience due to exposure to certain chemicals present in common household products. Sensitivities can manifest as a range of symptoms, from mild irritation to more severe allergic reactions.

**Key points:**

* **Common Triggers:** Fragrances, preservatives, candles, dyes, surfactants, certain metals (e.g., nickel), and other additives.

* **Fragrances:** Many products, including air fresheners, cleaning agents, and personal care items, contain synthetic fragrances that can cause adverse reactions in some individuals.

* **Toiletries:** Shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, lotions, and other personal care products may contain allergens or irritants that can cause skin reactions.

* **Detergents:** Residual detergent on clothing and bedding can come into contact with the skin, leading to skin sensitivities. Fragrances, dyes, and certain enzymes in laundry detergents may be triggers.

* **Cleaners:** Cleaning agents often contain various chemicals, such as surfactants, disinfectants, and solvents.

* **Symptoms:** Skin reactions (rashes, itching, redness), respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, wheezing), eye irritation, nasal congestion, headaches, and fatigue.

* **Air Fresheners:** Air fresheners and scented candles may release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and synthetic fragrances that can cause respiratory symptoms and irritate the eyes and skin.

* **Hypoallergenic Products:** Some individuals with sensitivities opt for hypoallergenic products that are formulated to minimize the use of common allergens and irritants. These products may be labeled as suitable for sensitive skin.

* **Avoidance and Substitution:** Managing household product sensitivities often involves avoiding products known to trigger reactions and substituting them with alternative, less irritating options.
    
* **Read product labels:** Choosing products labeled as "fragrance-free," "hypoallergenic," or "sensitive skin".
