# Small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO)

Small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO) is a condition where there is an excessive growth of fungi, particularly Candida species, in the small intestine. Although less commonly recognized than [small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)](../small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth/), SIFO can lead to significant gastrointestinal distress and symptoms.

Symptoms of SIFO often overlap with those of SIBO and other gastrointestinal disorders, including bloating, gas, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Because these symptoms are non-specific and similar to other conditions, SIFO can be challenging to diagnose. Patients with underlying conditions that compromise the immune system or alter gut flora, such as diabetes, prolonged antibiotic use, or immunosuppressive therapy, are at higher risk for developing SIFO.

Diagnosis of SIFO typically involves collecting small intestine fluid samples via endoscopy and analyzing them for fungal cultures. Unlike SIBO, breath tests are not effective for diagnosing SIFO due to the different metabolic processes of fungi compared to bacteria.

Treatment for SIFO generally includes antifungal medications such as fluconazole or itraconazole to reduce fungal overgrowth. In addition to pharmacological treatments, addressing underlying risk factors, modifying the diet, and potentially incorporating probiotics to restore a healthy balance of gut flora can be beneficial.
