# Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is a dietary approach designed to help lower blood pressure and promote heart health. It emphasizes consuming foods rich in nutrients that are known to help lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fiber, while limiting foods high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.

**Key principles**:

* **Emphasize fruits and vegetables:** Aim to include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet each day. These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they are low in calories. Fresh, frozen, or canned (without added salt) options are all acceptable.

* **Choose whole grains:** Opt for whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and oatmeal instead of refined grains like white rice and white bread. Whole grains provide fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health.

* **Include lean protein sources:** Choose lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, and nuts. These foods are lower in saturated fat and cholesterol compared to red meat and processed meats.

* **Limit saturated fat and cholesterol:** Reduce your intake of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol, such as fatty cuts of meat, full-fat dairy products, and fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fats found in olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds.

* **Cut back on sodium:** Limit your intake of sodium, which can raise blood pressure. Aim to consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, or even less if you have hypertension or are at risk of developing it. To reduce sodium intake, avoid processed and packaged foods, which often contain high levels of sodium, and use herbs, spices, and other flavorings to season foods instead of salt.

* **Moderate alcohol consumption:** If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Limit alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.

* **Watch portion sizes:** Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating, which can contribute to weight gain and high blood pressure. Use smaller plates and bowls, and be mindful of serving sizes when preparing meals.

The DASH diet has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease when combined with other healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight. It is considered a balanced and sustainable approach to eating for overall health and well-being.
