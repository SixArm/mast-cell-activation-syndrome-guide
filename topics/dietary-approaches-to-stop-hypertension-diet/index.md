# Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet

Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a diet for heart health. It emphasizes foods rich in nutrients that help lower blood pressure, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fiber, while limiting foods high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.

**Key principles**:

* **Emphasize fruits and vegetables**: Aim to include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet each day. These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Fresh, frozen, or canned (without added salt) options are all acceptable.

* **Choose whole grains**: Opt for whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and oatmeal instead of refined grains like white rice and white bread. Whole grains provide fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health.

* **Include lean protein sources**: Choose lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, and nuts.

* **Limit saturated fat and cholesterol**: Reduce your intake of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol, such as fatty cuts of meat, full-fat dairy products, and fried foods. Instead, opt for healthier fats found in olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds.

* **Cut back on sodium**: Sodium can raise blood pressure. Limit sodium to 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, or even less if you have hypertension or are at risk of developing it.

* **Moderate alcohol**: Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day.
 
* **Watch portion sizes**: Use smaller portion sizes to avoid overeating.
