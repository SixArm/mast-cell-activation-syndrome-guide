# Histamine metabolism of foods

[Source](https://www.histaminintoleranz.ch/downloads/SIGHI-Leaflet_HistamineEliminationDiet.pdf)

Foods affect the histamine levels in a variety of ways.

**Mechanisms**:

* **Histamine-containing foods**: Histamine is formed as a deterioration product
  in perishable food, in microbial fermentation and maturation processes and in
  the ripening of fruit. Medication: DAOSIN (works best if ingested
  15-30 minutes before meal), H1 antihistamines, possibly H2 antihistamines.

* **Biogenic amines besides histamine**: Several amines share the same main
  degradation pathway with histamine: They are competing substrates, degraded by
  the same enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). The DAO prefers other amines before it
  degrades histamine. Medication: H1 antihistamines, DAOSIN.

* **Histamine liberators**: Some foods and additives release endogenous
  histamine from certain cell types (mainly from mast cells). This mechanism is
  independent from a lack of diamine oxidase (DAO). Medication: H1
  antihistamines, cromoglicic acid (or its salt sodium cromoglicate or cromolyn
  sodium), ibuprofen. DAOSIN has no direct effect.

* **Diamine oxidase inhibitors**: Diamine oxidase is a sensitive molecule that
  can be inhibited in its activity by chemical influences. Foods and additives
  can block the breakdown of histamine by the DAO. Medication: H1
  antihistamines. DAOSIN supports the reduction of biogenic amines, but is
  ineffective against DAO inhibitors.

* **Intestinal permeability**: Certain substances increase the intestinal
  permeability ("Leaky Gut Syndrome") and risk to develop an IgE or IgG food
  allergy or poisoning. Medication: mast cell stabilizers with continuous
  application, H1 antihistamines. DAOSIN has no effect.
