# Histamine metabolism of foods

It is important to understand what foods affect the histamine levels in which
way. A histamine intolerance can have various causes with different underlying
pathogenetic mechanisms. This may be one of the reasons why people react
differently to foods or categories of triggers. This knowledge is also relevant
for treatment, because different mechanisms may need different treatments.

* **Histamine-containing foods**: Histamine is formed as a deterioration product
  in perishable food, in microbial fermentation and maturation processes and in
  the ripening of fruit. Even some vegetables are naturally histamine
  containing, although very fresh. Medication: DAOSIN (works best if ingested
  15-30 minutes before meal), H1 antihistamines, possibly H2 antihistamines.

* **Biogenic amines besides histamine**: Several amines share the same main
  degradation pathway with histamine: They are competing substrates, degraded by
  the same enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO). The DAO prefers other amines before it
  degrades histamine. While the DAO is busy with the breakdown of other biogenic
  amines, the breakdown of hista mine is temporarily decreased or blocked. Some
  of these biogenic amines have properties similar to those of histamine and can
  cause histamine-like symptoms directly. Medication: H1 antihistamines, DAOSIN.

* **Histamine liberators**: Some foods and additives release endogenous
  histamine from certain cell types (mainly from mast cells). This mechanism is
  independent from a lack of diamine oxidase (DAO). Histamine release is
  enhanced in persons with mast cell activation disease (MCAD) and to a lesser
  extent maybe also when the enzyme activity of histamine-N-methyltransferase
  (HNMT) is reduced. HNMT is an intracellular histamine degradation pathway.
  Even healthy people can react to liberators if the dose is strong enough.
  Medication: H1 antihistamines, cromoglicic acid (or its salt sodium
  cromoglicate or cromolyn sodium), ibuprofen. DAOSIN has no direct effect.
  
* **Diamine oxidase inhibitors**: Diamine oxidase is a sensitive molecule that
  can be inhibited in its activity by chemical influences. Foods and additives can
  block the breakdown of histamine by the DAO. It is still too little known about
  which substances can inhibit The activity of histamine N-methyltransferase
  (HNMT) can also be inhibited by chemicals, but it is little known about which
  substances are inhibitors. Medication: H1 antihistamines. DAOSIN supports the
  reduction of biogenic amines, but is ineffective against DAO inhibitors.

* **Increase in intestinal permeability**: Certain substances affect the
  intestinal permeability ("Leaky Gut Syndrome"). They make the intestines to
  leak, so that macromolecules and other substances from the digestive tract can
  enter the body, which normally is not the case. This enhances the risk to
  develop an IgE or IgG food allergy or poisoning. Medication: mast cell
  stabilizers with continuous application, H1 antihistamines. DAOSIN has no
  effect.
