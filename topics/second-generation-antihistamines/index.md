# Second-generation antihistamines

Second-generation antihistamines are a class of medications designed to treat allergic reactions with minimal sedative effects, making them more suitable for long-term use compared to first-generation antihistamines. Examples of second-generation antihistamines include cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine (Allegra). These drugs selectively block histamine H1 receptors, thereby reducing symptoms such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and hives.

A significant advantage of second-generation antihistamines is their reduced ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, which minimizes their sedative effects. This characteristic allows individuals to use these medications without experiencing significant drowsiness or cognitive impairment, making them ideal for daily use, especially for those who need to remain alert and active.

Second-generation antihistamines also have a longer duration of action, typically requiring only once-daily dosing, which enhances convenience and adherence to treatment regimens. They are effective in managing both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, as well as chronic urticaria (hives).

These medications are generally well-tolerated, with a lower incidence of anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and urinary retention compared to first-generation antihistamines. However, as with any medication, some individuals may experience side effects, including headache or gastrointestinal discomfort.
