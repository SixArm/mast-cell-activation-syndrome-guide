# Excipients

Excipients are inactive ingredients added to pharmaceutical formulations alongside the active drug substance. These substances serve various functions, such as facilitating drug delivery, improving stability, enhancing taste or appearance, or aiding in the manufacturing process. However, it's important to consider potential interactions or sensitivities to excipients, particularly in individuals with allergies or sensitivities to specific ingredients.

**Common types**:

* **Fillers and Diluents**: These bulk up the formulation. Examples: lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, mannitol.

* **Binders**: This hold the ingredients of a tablet or capsule together and provide cohesion. Examples: cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), starches, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).

* **Disintegrants**: These promote the rapid breakup of tablets or capsules in the gastrointestinal tract. Examples: croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate.

* **Lubricants and Glidants**: Lubricants reduce friction between the tablet ingredients and the tablet press, preventing sticking and improving the flow of powder during manufacturing. Glidants improve powder flow properties by reducing interparticle friction. Examples: magnesium stearate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide.

* **Coatings**: These are applied to tablets or capsules to improve appearance, taste, swallowability, or stability. Examples: shellac, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), polyethylene glycol.

* **Preservatives**: These are added to formulations to prevent microbial growth and extend shelf life. ExamplesL benzalkonium chloride, methylparaben, propylparaben.

* **Flavorings**: These are added to improve the taste of oral dosage forms, particularly liquids or chewables. Examples include artificial flavors (e.g., mint, cherry) and sweeteners (e.g., sucrose, sorbitol, saccharin).

* **Colorants**: These enhance appearance, aid in product identification, or mask color changes during manufacturing or storage. Examples: synthetic dyes (e.g., FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Red No. 40) and natural colorants (e.g., iron oxides, titanium dioxide).
