# Excipients

Excipients are inactive ingredients added to medications. Some individuals have sensitivities to specific excipients.

**Common types**:

* **Fillers and Diluents**: These bulk up the formulation. Examples: lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, mannitol.

* **Binders**: These hold the ingredients together. Examples: cellulose derivatives (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), starches, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).

* **Disintegrants**: These promote the rapid breakup of tablets or capsules in the gastrointestinal tract. Examples: croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate.

* **Lubricants and Glidants**: These reduce friction in the tablet ingredients, and between the tablet and the press during manufacturing. Examples: magnesium stearate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide.

* **Coatings**: These improve appearance, taste, swallowability, or stability. Examples: shellac, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), polyethylene glycol.

* **Preservatives**: These are added to formulations to prevent microbial growth and extend shelf life. Examples: benzalkonium chloride, methylparaben, propylparaben.

* **Flavorings**: These are added to improve the taste of oral dosage forms. Examples: artificial flavors (e.g. mint, cherry) and sweeteners (e.g. sucrose, sorbitol, saccharin).

* **Colorants**: These enhance appearance, aid in product identification, or mask color changes during manufacturing or storage. Examples: synthetic dyes (e.g. FD&C Red No. 40) and natural colorants (e.g. iron oxides, titanium dioxide).
