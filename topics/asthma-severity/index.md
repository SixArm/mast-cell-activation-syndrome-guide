# Asthma severity

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that can vary in severity from person to person. Healthcare providers often assess asthma severity to guide treatment and management strategies. The severity of asthma is generally categorized into several levels.

Intermittent Asthma:

* Exacerbations (asthma attacks) are brief and not severe.

* Symptoms occur on two days or fewer per week.

* Nighttime awakenings due to asthma are two times or fewer per month.

* Lung function is generally normal between exacerbations.

Mild Persistent Asthma:

* Exacerbations may affect daily activities but are generally not severe.

* Symptoms occur more than two days per week but not daily.

* Nighttime awakenings due to asthma are more than two times per month.

* Lung function is generally normal between exacerbations.

Moderate Persistent Asthma:

* Daily symptoms are common.

* Nighttime awakenings due to asthma are more than once a week.

* Lung function is reduced, with FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) between 60% and 80% of the predicted value.

* Exacerbations may be more severe and affect daily activities.

Severe Persistent Asthma:

* Exacerbations are frequent and may be severe, limiting daily activities.

* Symptoms occur throughout the day and frequently at night.

* Nighttime awakenings due to asthma occur often.

* Lung function is significantly reduced, with FEV1 less than 60% of the predicted value.
