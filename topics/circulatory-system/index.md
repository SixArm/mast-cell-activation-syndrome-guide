# Circulatory system

The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is a vital organ system in the human body responsible for the transportation of blood, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products to and from cells throughout the body. It plays a central role in maintaining homeostasis, which is the body's ability to maintain a stable and balanced internal environment. The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.

Key componentsâ€¦

* Heart: The heart is a muscular organ that acts as the pump of the circulatory system. It contracts rhythmically to propel blood throughout the body. It is divided into four chambers: the left and right atria, which receive blood, and the left and right ventricles, which pump blood out of the heart.

* Blood Vessels: Blood vessels are a network of tubular structures that carry blood. There are three main types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to various parts of the body. Veins transport deoxygenated blood from body tissues back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that connect arteries and veins. They facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between blood and cells.

* Blood: Blood is a fluid connective tissue that flows through the circulatory system. It consists of various components, including red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, white blood cells (leukocytes) that fight infection, platelets that help in clotting, and plasma, which is a liquid component containing water, electrolytes, and proteins.
