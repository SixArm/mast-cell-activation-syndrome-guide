# Circulatory system

The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is a vital organ system in the human body responsible for the transportation of blood, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products to and from cells throughout the body.

**Key points**:

* **Heart**: The heart is a muscular organ that acts as the pump of the circulatory system. It contracts rhythmically to propel blood throughout the body. It is divided into four chambers: the left and right atria, which receive blood, and the left and right ventricles, which pump blood out of the heart.

* **Blood**: Blood is a fluid that flows through blood vessels. Blood consists of various components, including red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, white blood cells (leukocytes) that fight infection, platelets that help in clotting, and plasma that contains water, electrolytes, and proteins.

* **Transportation**: Transport oxygen from the lungs to body tissues. Transport carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs for elimination. Carry nutrients from the digestive system to cells. Remove metabolic waste products.

* **Hormone Distribution**: Hormones produced by endocrine glands are released into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body.

* **Temperature Regulation**: Blood helps distribute heat throughout the body, maintaining a stable core body temperature.

* **Clotting**: Platelets and clotting factors in the blood are essential for stopping bleeding when blood vessels are damaged.

* **Blood Pressure**: The circulatory system helps regulate blood pressure, ensuring that blood flows at an appropriate pressure to reach all parts of the body.
