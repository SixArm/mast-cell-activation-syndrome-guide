# Low-FODMAP diet

A low-FODMAP diet is a dietary approach designed to manage and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The goal is to identify and manage specific triggers, then develop an eating plan. FODMAPs are types of carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the small intestine. When these carbohydrates reach the colon, they can be fermented by gut bacteria, leading to gas production and gastrointestinal discomfort in some people.

**FODMAP stands for:**

* **Fermentable Oligosaccharides:** Found in foods like wheat, rye, onions, garlic, and legumes.

* **Disaccharides:** Lactose-containing products such as milk, yogurt, and some soft cheeses.

* **Monosaccharides:** Fruits like apples, pears, and honey that contain excess fructose.

* **Polyols:** Found in certain fruits (e.g., cherries, peaches) and sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol).

**Key phases:**

* **1. Elimination Phase:** Restrict high-FODMAP foods for 2-6 weeks to allow the gastrointestinal system to settle and symptoms to improve.

* **2. Reintroduction (Challenge) Phase:** Reintroduce specific FODMAPs in a controlled manner, to identify which ones trigger symptoms in the individual.

* **3. Maintenance Phase:** Develop a personalized long-term diet that includes foods low in FODMAPs that can be consumed without triggering symptoms, and limits foods that are triggers or are high in FODMAPs.
