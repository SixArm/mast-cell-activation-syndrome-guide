# Low-FODMAP diet

A low-FODMAP diet is a dietary approach designed to manage and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and certain other digestive conditions. FODMAP is an acronym that stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols, which are types of carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the small intestine. When these carbohydrates reach the colon, they can be fermented by gut bacteria, leading to gas production and gastrointestinal discomfort in some people.

The low-FODMAP diet aims to reduce the intake of foods that are high in FODMAPs and then systematically reintroduce them to identify which specific FODMAPs trigger symptoms in an individual.

Key phasesâ€¦

1. Elimination Phase: During this phase, high-FODMAP foods are restricted for a period of 2 to 6 weeks to allow the gastrointestinal system to settle and symptoms to improve. Foods to avoid or limit during this phase include:

    * Oligosaccharides: Found in foods like wheat, rye, onions, garlic, and legumes.

    * Disaccharides: Lactose-containing products such as milk, yogurt, and some soft cheeses.

    * Monosaccharides: Fruits like apples, pears, and honey that contain excess fructose.

    * Polyols: Found in certain fruits (e.g., cherries, peaches) and sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol).

2. Reintroduction (Challenge) Phase: After the elimination phase, specific FODMAPs are reintroduced one at a time, in a controlled manner, to identify which ones trigger symptoms in the individual. This phase helps determine personal tolerance and pinpoint the specific FODMAPs that should be limited.

3. Maintenance Phase: Based on the results of the reintroduction phase, a personalized long-term diet is established. This diet includes foods low in FODMAPs that can be consumed without triggering symptoms, while foods high in FODMAPs are limited or avoided.

The goal of the low-FODMAP diet is to provide symptom relief while maintaining a nutritionally balanced and diverse diet. Not everyone with gastrointestinal symptoms will need to follow a low-FODMAP diet, and it should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional or registered dietitian. Additionally, the diet can be complex and may require careful planning to ensure that essential nutrients are not compromised.

It's important to note that the low-FODMAP diet is not intended to be a long-term or permanent diet but rather a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The ultimate goal is to identify and manage specific triggers of gastrointestinal symptoms and develop an eating plan that minimizes discomfort while allowing for as much dietary variety as possible.
