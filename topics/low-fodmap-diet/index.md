# Low-FODMAP diet

A low-FODMAP diet is a dietary approach designed to manage and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and certain other digestive conditions. The goal is to identify and manage specific triggers, then  develop an eating plan that minimizes discomfort while providing nutrition and variety.

FODMAP is an acronym that stands for:

    * Fermentable Oligosaccharides: Found in foods like wheat, rye, onions, garlic, and legumes.

    * Disaccharides: Lactose-containing products such as milk, yogurt, and some soft cheeses.

    * Monosaccharides: Fruits like apples, pears, and honey that contain excess fructose.

    * Polyols: Found in certain fruits (e.g., cherries, peaches) and sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol).

FODMAPs are types of carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the small intestine. When these carbohydrates reach the colon, they can be fermented by gut bacteria, leading to gas production and gastrointestinal discomfort in some people.

Key phasesâ€¦

1. Elimination Phase: During this phase, high-FODMAP foods are restricted for a period of 2 to 6 weeks to allow the gastrointestinal system to settle and symptoms to improve. Foods to avoid or limit during this phase include:

2. Reintroduction (Challenge) Phase: After the elimination phase, specific FODMAPs are reintroduced one at a time, in a controlled manner, to identify which ones trigger symptoms in the individual. This phase helps determine personal tolerance and pinpoint the specific FODMAPs that should be limited.

3. Maintenance Phase: Based on the results of the reintroduction phase, a personalized long-term diet is established. This diet includes foods low in FODMAPs that can be consumed without triggering symptoms, while foods high in FODMAPs are limited or avoided.
