# Carnivore diet

The carnivore diet is a type of diet that emphasizes the consumption of animal products exclusively and excludes plant-based foods. Individuals following the carnivore diet typically eat meat, fish, and other animal-derived foods while eliminating fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and other plant-based foods.

Proponents of the carnivore diet suggest potential benefits such as improved energy levels, weight loss, and relief from certain health issues.

**Key points**:

* **Eat Animal Products**: Focus on consumption of animal products, including red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy (if tolerated).

* **Eat Fats and Proteins**: Prioritize fatty cuts of meat to meet calorie energy needs, because the diet is low in carbohydrates.

* **Omit Plant Products**: Exclude fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds.

* **Omit Processed Foods**: Exclude processed foods, additives, and artificial ingredients.

**Risks**:

* **Nutrient Deficiency**: Excluding plant foods can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, and phytonutrients found in fruits and vegetables.

* **Digestive Issues**: Some individuals may experience digestive issues such as constipation due to the lack of fiber.

* **Long-Term Health Risks**: A carnivore diet lacks the diversity of nutrients found in a balanced diet. There are concerns about potential negative effects on heart health, kidney function, and other aspects of long-term health.
