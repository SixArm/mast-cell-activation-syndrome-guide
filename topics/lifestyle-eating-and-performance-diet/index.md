# Lifestyle, Eating, And Performance (LEAP) diet

The Lifestyle, Eating, and Performance (LEAP) diet is a personalized nutrition plan designed to address food sensitivities and chronic inflammatory conditions. Developed by immunologist Dr. Mark Pasula, the LEAP diet aims to identify and eliminate foods that trigger adverse reactions, thereby reducing symptoms and promoting overall health. It is particularly beneficial for individuals suffering from conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), migraines, fibromyalgia, and other inflammatory disorders.

The LEAP diet begins with a comprehensive blood test known as the Mediator Release Test (MRT), which measures the bodyâ€™s immune response to 170 different foods and food chemicals. This test helps pinpoint specific foods that cause inflammation and other negative reactions in the body. Based on the MRT results, a customized diet plan is created, starting with a period of strict elimination of the identified trigger foods. This phase helps to calm the immune system and reduce symptoms.

Following the elimination phase, foods are gradually reintroduced in a controlled manner to monitor for any reactions. This methodical approach allows individuals to identify and confirm their specific food sensitivities, leading to a sustainable, long-term eating plan that supports optimal health and performance. The LEAP diet emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods and encourages balanced meals that provide essential nutrients while avoiding problematic ingredients.

Adopting the LEAP diet requires commitment and careful planning, but many individuals report significant improvements in their symptoms and overall quality of life. Working with a trained LEAP dietitian can provide guidance and support throughout the process, ensuring that the diet is both effective and nutritionally adequate. By addressing food sensitivities and reducing inflammation, the LEAP diet offers a tailored approach to enhancing health and well-being.
