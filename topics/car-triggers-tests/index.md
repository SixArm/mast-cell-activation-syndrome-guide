# Car triggers - tests

Cars can have many triggers. If you react when you're in a car, then consider these tests. Try each one, and see if it makes a difference. See [car triggers](../car-triggers) and [car triggers - treatment](../car-triggers-treatments/).

**Tangible trigger tests**:

* **Airborne trigger tests**: Sit in your car, engine off, wearing a mask that is a N99 or painter's respirator (not N95), plus full-body  clothes, gloves, goggles, and a hat. Don't touch anything. Does this make a difference?

* **Contact trigger tests**: Same as above, then remove the gloves and touch everything in your car.

**Intangible trigger tests**:

* **Stress trigger tests**: Try the above protections, while driving safely.

* **Energy trigger tests**: Try turning off Bluetooth, WiFi, and any other electronics. Try driving on a leisurely weekend versus a hectic weekday. Does any of this make a difference?

* **Vibrations**: Try driving on a smooth road versus a bumpy road. If your car has engine stop-start, try deactivating it because it can cause unusual vibrations.

**More tests**:

* **Be a passenger**: Try these same tests, while having someone else drive you.

* **Try another car**: Try these same tests, while driving someone else's car. If possible, try an all-electric car because this can help rule out many of the gasoline-engine aspects.
