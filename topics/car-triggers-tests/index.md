# Car triggers - tests

Cars can have many triggers. If you react when you're in a car, then consider these tests. Try each one, and see if it makes a difference. See [car triggers](../car-triggers) and [car triggers - treatment](../car-triggers-treatments/).

**Tangible trigger tests**:

* **Airborne trigger tests**: Sit in your car, engine off, wearing a mask that is a N99 or painter's respirator (not N95), plus full-body  clothes, gloves, goggles, and a hat. Don't touch anything. Does this make a difference? 

* **Contact trigger tests**: Same as above, then remove the gloves and touch everything in your car.

**Intangible trigger tests**:

* **Stress trigger tests**: Try the above protections, while driving safely. 

* **Try turning off Bluetooth, WiFi, and any other electronics. Try driving on a leisurely weekend versus a hectic weekday. Does any of this make a difference?

* **Vibrations**: Try driving on a smooth road versus a bumpy road. If your car has engine stop-start, try activating it because it can cause unusual vibrations.

**Intangible triggers**:

* **Stress triggers**: emotional stress from going to work, anxiety from leaving the house, adrenaline increase from driving, fear of potential accidents, feeling startled, motion sickness, being with other people in the car, etc.
  
* **Energy triggers**: heat, electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as Bluetooth or WiFi, bright lights, loud sounds (even the car door closing), etc.

* **Vibration triggers**: engine rumbles, shocks from driving over rough roads, automatic stop-start banging, etc.

**More tests**:

* **Be a passenger**: Try these same tests, while having someone else drive you.

* **Try another carr**: Try these same tests, while driving someone else's car. If possible, try an all-electric car because this can help rule out many of the gasoline-engine aspects.
