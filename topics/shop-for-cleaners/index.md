# Shop for cleaners

Cleaners that mast cell patients say work for them.

Start with Seventh Generation Free And Clear, because it is widely available and generally well-tolerated.

Look for labels that say "free and clear" "hypoallergenic" or "no dyes and no scents". Avoid bleach and ammonia. Avoid humectants such as polyethylene glycols (PEG) and polypropylene glycols (PPG). Avoid artificial additives such as colors and scents. Potentially avoid almond, citrus, coconut.

Consider making your own cleaner, such as with  peroxide and vinegar. Consider using hand soap, dish powder, and rinse aid by Seventh Generation. Microfiber cloths are great.
