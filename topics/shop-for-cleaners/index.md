# Shop for cleaners

Cleaners that mast cell patients say work for them.

If you're in a rush, try Seventh Generation products, because they are widely available and generally well-tolerated. Try the cleaners, hand soap, dish powder, and rinse aid.

If you have more time, look for labels that say "free and clear" "hypoallergenic" or "no dyes and no scents". Avoid bleach and ammonia. Avoid humectants such as polyethylene glycols (PEG) and polypropylene glycols (PPG). Avoid artificial additives such as colors and scents. Potentially avoid almond, citrus, coconut. Consider making your own cleaner, such as with peroxide and vinegar. Prefer microfiber cloths over paper towels.
