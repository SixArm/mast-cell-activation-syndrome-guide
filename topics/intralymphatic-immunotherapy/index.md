# Intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT)

Intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) is an innovative approach to allergy treatment that involves injecting allergens directly into the lymph nodes. This method aims to enhance the immune systemâ€™s tolerance to allergens more efficiently and quickly than traditional subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy. By delivering the allergens straight to the lymph nodes, where immune responses are orchestrated, ILIT can potentially provide faster and more robust desensitization.

ILIT typically requires only three injections, administered at monthly intervals, making it significantly less burdensome for patients compared to the frequent dosing schedules of conventional immunotherapies. This streamlined approach not only improves patient compliance but also accelerates the therapeutic process, often achieving results within weeks rather than months or years.

The procedure is performed using ultrasound guidance to accurately target the lymph nodes, usually in the groin area. The precise delivery of allergens to the lymphatic system enhances the activation of regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in suppressing allergic responses. As a result, ILIT can reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients with allergies such as hay fever, dust mites, or certain food allergies.

Clinical trials have shown promising results, demonstrating that ILIT can be both safe and effective. The main side effects are typically mild and localized, such as swelling or discomfort at the injection site. However, as with all immunotherapies, there is a risk of systemic allergic reactions, which necessitates the procedure being performed in a controlled medical environment.
