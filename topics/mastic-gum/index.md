# Mastic gum

Mastic gum is a resin obtained from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus), primarily found on the Greek island of Chios. This natural substance has been used for centuries for its medicinal and culinary properties. Mastic gum is traditionally chewed as a gum and has a distinctive, slightly bitter flavor that turns into a refreshing taste as it is chewed.

One of the primary uses of mastic gum is for digestive health. It has been shown to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in treating various gastrointestinal disorders. Studies suggest that mastic gum can help reduce symptoms of indigestion, peptic ulcers, and Helicobacter pylori infection, a common cause of ulcers and stomach inflammation. By promoting gut health, mastic gum can alleviate symptoms such as bloating, abdominal discomfort, and acid reflux.

Additionally, mastic gum is known for its oral health benefits. It has natural antimicrobial properties that help reduce oral bacteria, leading to improved dental hygiene and fresher breath. Chewing mastic gum can help prevent cavities, gum disease, and plaque buildup.

Beyond its health benefits, mastic gum is used in various culinary applications, particularly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines. It is an ingredient in sweets, ice cream, and liqueurs, imparting a unique flavor and aroma.
