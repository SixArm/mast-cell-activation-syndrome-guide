# Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of antidepressant medications used to treat major depressive disorder and other psychiatric conditions, particularly when other treatments have failed. MAOIs work by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. By preventing this breakdown, MAOIs increase the levels of these neurotransmitters, thereby improving mood and alleviating symptoms of depression.

Some commonly known MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and isocarboxazid (Marplan). Despite their effectiveness, MAOIs are generally considered a last resort due to their potential for severe side effects and dietary restrictions. One of the main concerns with MAOIs is the risk of hypertensive crisis, a sudden and dangerous increase in blood pressure, which can occur if patients consume foods high in tyramine, such as aged cheeses, cured meats, and certain fermented products.

Other side effects of MAOIs may include dizziness, insomnia, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Additionally, MAOIs can interact with various medications, including other antidepressants, over-the-counter cold remedies, and certain anesthetics, making them less convenient and more complex to manage.

Given these challenges, the use of MAOIs requires careful monitoring by healthcare professionals. Patients prescribed MAOIs need to adhere to strict dietary guidelines and be vigilant about potential drug interactions. Despite these drawbacks, MAOIs remain a valuable treatment option for individuals with treatment-resistant depression, offering hope when other antidepressants are ineffective.
