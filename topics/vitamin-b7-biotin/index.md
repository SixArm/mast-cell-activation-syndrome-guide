# Vitamin B7 = Biotin

Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in various metabolic functions within the body. Biotin is essential for the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It also plays a role in maintaining healthy hair, skin, and nails. 

**Key aspects**:

* **Metabolism**: Biotin serves as a coenzyme in several carboxylation reactions that are involved in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and certain amino acids. It assists enzymes in breaking down substances for energy production.

* **Hair, Skin, and Nail Health**: Biotin is often associated with supporting healthy hair, skin, and nails. It is commonly included in supplements targeting these areas due to its role in maintaining their health.

* **Cellular Growth**: Biotin is important for normal cell growth, which is necessary for the maintenance of healthy tissues.

* **Pregnancy**: Adequate biotin levels are crucial during pregnancy for normal embryonic growth. However, pregnancy may increase the need for biotin.

* **Blood Sugar Regulation**: Some research suggests that biotin might play a role in helping to maintain normal blood sugar levels.

* **Deficiency**: This is relatively rare but can occur, leading to symptoms like hair loss, skin rash, and neurological issues.
  
Dietary sources of biotin include a variety of foods such as organ meats (like liver and kidney), egg yolk, nuts, seeds, certain vegetables (such as sweet potatoes and spinach), and some fruits (like avocados). Bacteria in the gut also produce small amounts of biotin, contributing to the body's overall supply.
