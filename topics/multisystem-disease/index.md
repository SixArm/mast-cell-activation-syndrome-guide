# Multisystem disease

"Multisystem disease" is a broad medical term that refers to a condition or disorder that affects multiple organ systems in the body. These diseases often involve a wide range of symptoms and complications, making diagnosis and management complex. Multisystem diseases can be caused by various factors, including infections, autoimmune reactions, genetic mutations, and environmental influences.
