# Ketamine therapy

Ketamine is an anesthetic medication that has therapy use in mental health treatments, such as for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

**Key points**:

* **NMDA Receptor Modulation**: Ketamine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leading to increased levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This, in turn, triggers a cascade of effects that may contribute to its antidepressant properties.

* **Rapid Onset of Effects**: Individuals may experience improvements in mood within hours or days, in contrast to the delayed onset often seen with traditional antidepressants.

* **Administration Routes**: Ketamine can be administered via different routes, including intravenous (IV) infusion, intramuscular injection, or, more recently, as a nasal spray called esketamine.

* **Treatment-Resistant Depression**: Ketamine is often considered in cases of treatment-resistant depression where individuals have not responded to other standard antidepressant treatments.

* **Maintenance Treatment**: The duration of ketamine's antidepressant effects can vary among individuals. Some may require maintenance treatments to sustain the benefits over time.

* **Potential Side Effects**: Ketamine treatment is not without potential side effects, including dissociation, nausea, and transient increases in blood pressure.
