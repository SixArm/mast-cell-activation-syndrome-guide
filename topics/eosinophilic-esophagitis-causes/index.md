# Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) causes

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) causes have five general kinds:

1. EoE caused by allergens. This is not directly related to MCAS, even though some allergies could trigger histamine overload which in turn could trigger more mast cell activation. This kind should respond well to antihistimines, antiallergens, allergy immunotherapy, and the like. 

2. EoE caused by throat reactions. This means irritants in the throat, such as spicy foods. This is not directly related to MCAS, even though the throat irritants could feel as if they are MCAS triggers. This kind should respond well to trigger minimization i.e. don't eat/drink things that hurt your throat, and also to 

3. EoE caused by ingestion-driven acid reflux. This means that inflames or injures the esophageal tissue. This can be caused by many things, such as certain foods and drinks, fatty or spicy foods, etc. This is not directly realted to MCAS, even though an MCAS-diet can help these symptoms quite a lot. This kind should respond well to antacids, which reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.

4. EoE is caused by a structural failure of the esophogaus. There is aA ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus that prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is generally diagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and could/should be examined by an upper GI endoscope a.ka. esophagogastroduodenoscopy. This kind should respond well to proton-pump inhibitors, as well as to physical changes, such as eating smaller meals, not lying down after a meal, lowering caffeine and alcohol, losing weight, etc.

5. EoE caused by hyperactivation of gastrointestinal mast cells. When mast cells are hyperactive, they release too much histamine, which  triggers too much stomach acid production (regardless of ingestion), which leads to acid reflux. This kind of EoE is caused by the mast cell disorder. This should respond well to mast cell stabilizers, including over-the-counter famotidine (brand name Pepcid) which is an H2 antihistamine and also has mast cell stabilizer effects.
