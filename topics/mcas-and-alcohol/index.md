# MCAS and alcohol 

Many MCAS patients have reactions to alcohol, such as liquor, wine, beer. Here are some quotations from people.

MCAS and Lyme disease have problems with alcohol consumption.

"Alcohol hurts my muscles immediately once the alcohol hits my stomach."

"It burns my arms, legs, neck, back. It happens immediately on the first few sips."

"I get an immediate reaction like a panic attack. I literally have to sit or lie on the floor to let my heart calm down."

"My arms go heavy and I get tachycardia."

"I'm allergic to sugar. I don't even mess around with it now."

"My skin becomes sensitive to touch, and feels very hot."

"I get flushing and itchy."

"Yes, I immediately get a distinctive weird ache in my shoulders and the side of my neck."

"My ears and face get red immediately with a sip of alcohol, then comes the shortness of breath."

"For me it's vocal cord dysfunction."

"My mom and I both get it! And it’s weird, because it’s only right at the very beginning of the drinks. First couple sips and I get this dull ache through my arms, legs, and back muscles. Then we can drink all night and not have that pain."

"I absolutely can not even have a sip of alcohol without being sick for over a week. Joint pain, flu like symptoms, severe fatigue, hot flashes, face flushing butterfly rash across cheeks and nose, neuropathy in hands and feet.'
