# Ketogenic diet

The ketogenic diet, a.k.a. keto diet, is a low-carbohydrate medium-protein high-fat diet. The goal is to induce ketosis, which shifts the body's energy source from carbohydrates and glucose to fat and ketones.

**Key points**:

* **Low Carbohydrates**: The ketogenic diet focuses on a large reduction in carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrates are restricted to a level that induces and maintains ketosis, such as 20 grams per day.

* **Moderate Protein**: Protein intake is moderate and is adjusted based on activity level, muscle mass, and health goals. Consuming too much protein can interfere with ketosis.

* **High Fat**: The diet is high in healthy fats, providing the majority of daily caloric intake. This includes sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, oils, and fatty cuts of meat.

**Benefits**:

* **Weight Loss**: The reduction in carbohydrate intake and the shift to using stored fat for energy can contribute to weight loss.

* **Blood Sugar Control**: People with diabetes or insulin resistance may experience improved blood sugar control.

* **Improved Mental Clarity**: Some individuals report increased mental clarity and focus when in ketosis.

* **Reduced Hunger**: The satiating effect of fats and the stabilization of blood sugar levels may lead to reduced feelings of hunger.

* **Therapeutic Uses**: The ketogenic diet has potential therapeutic benefits in certain medical conditions, such as histamine-related conditions and neurodegenerative disorders.
