# Ketogenic diet

The ketogenic diet, often referred to as the keto diet, is a low-carbohydrate, medium-protein, high-fat diet. The main goal is to induce ketosis, which means shifting the body's metabolic state from relying on carbohydrates (which turn into glucose) to relying on fatty acids (which turn into ketones).

**Key aspects:**

* **Low Carbohydrates:** The keto diet is characterized by a significant reduction in carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrates are restricted to a level that induces and maintains ketosis, such as 20 grams per day.

* **Moderate Protein:** Protein intake is moderate and is adjusted based on individual factors such as activity level, muscle mass, and health goals. Consuming too much protein can potentially interfere with ketosis.

* **High Fat:** The diet is high in healthy fats, providing the majority of daily caloric intake. This includes sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, oils, and fatty cuts of meat.

**Benefits:**

* **Weight Loss:** The reduction in carbohydrate intake and the shift to using stored fat for energy can contribute to weight loss.

* **Blood Sugar Control:** Some people with diabetes or insulin resistance may experience improved blood sugar control on a ketogenic diet.

* **Improved Mental Clarity:** Some individuals report increased mental clarity and focus when in ketosis.

* **Reduced Hunger:** The satiating effect of fats and the stabilization of blood sugar levels may lead to reduced feelings of hunger.

* **Potential Therapeutic Uses:** The ketogenic diet has been studied for its potential therapeutic benefits in certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders.

- **Nutrient Intake:** Care must be taken to ensure sufficient intake of essential nutrients, as the diet restricts certain food groups.
