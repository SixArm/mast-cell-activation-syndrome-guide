# Calcium D-glucarate

Calcium D-glucarate is a natural compound found in fruits and vegetables, and it is also available as a dietary supplement. It is the calcium salt of D-glucaric acid, a substance that the body produces in small amounts. Calcium D-glucarate is known for its potential health benefits, particularly in supporting detoxification processes in the body.

**Key points**:

* **Detoxification**: Calcium D-glucarate is thought to support detoxification by aiding the body in the elimination of certain toxins and hormones. It works by inhibiting the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which can interfere with the detoxification process in the liver.

* **Estrogen Metabolism**: One area of interest for Calcium D-glucarate is its potential role in estrogen metabolism. It is believed to help the body excrete excess estrogen and reduce its reabsorption, potentially benefiting conditions related to hormonal balance.

* **Cancer Prevention**: Some studies suggest that Calcium D-glucarate may have anti-cancer properties. By supporting detoxification and reducing the reabsorption of certain toxins, it may contribute to a lower risk of certain types of cancer.

* **Liver Health**: The liver plays a central role in detoxification, and Calcium D-glucarate is thought to support liver health by promoting the elimination of toxins and waste products.

* **Dietary Sources**: Calcium D-glucarate is naturally present in various fruits and vegetables, with notable sources including oranges, apples, grapefruit, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.
