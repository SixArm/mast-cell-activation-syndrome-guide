# Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)

Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is one of the water-soluble B-vitamins. Pyridoxine is required for the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and fats. It also contributes to the synthesis of neurotransmitters and helps in maintaining a healthy immune system.

**Key points**:

* **Amino Acid Metabolism**: Pyridoxine is crucial for the metabolism of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. It helps convert one amino acid into another and plays a role in the synthesis of nonessential amino acids.

* **Neurotransmitter Synthesis**: Vitamin B6 is involved in the production of several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

* **Immune Function**: Pyridoxine is important for maintaining a healthy immune system. It plays a role in the production of antibodies and helps the body fight infections.

* **Hemoglobin Formation**: It contributes to the formation of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues.

* **Hormone Regulation**: Vitamin B6 is involved in the regulation of hormonal activity and may be beneficial for conditions like premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

* **Deficiency**: This is relatively rare, but it can lead to symptoms like anemia, skin disorders, mood disturbances, and impaired immune function.

Dietary sources of vitamin B6 include a variety of foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, bananas, avocados, whole grains, nuts, and legumes. Pyridoxine is water-soluble and not stored in the body for extended periods, so it must be obtained regularly through the diet.
