# Blood cells

Blood is composed of various types of cells that serve different functions in the body. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, a spongy tissue found within the cavities of certain bones.

Blood cell counts and the ratio of these cells are essential for maintaining overall health and preventing various medical conditions. Regular blood tests, such as complete blood counts (CBC), can provide valuable information about the levels and health of these blood cells.

The main types of blood cells:

* **Red Blood Cells (RBCs) (a.k.a. erythrocytes)**: Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cell in the body. Their primary function is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and organs and carry carbon dioxide, a waste product, from the tissues back to the lungs for exhalation.

* **White Blood Cells (WBCs) (a.k.a. leukocytes)**: White blood cells are a key part of the body's immune system and are responsible for defending the body against infections and foreign invaders.  White blood cells can identify and destroy pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as remove damaged or dead cells from the body.

* **Platelets (a.k.a. thrombocytes)**: Platelets are small cell fragments that play a vital role in blood clotting and the prevention of excessive bleeding. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets aggregate at the site of the injury, stick together, and release chemical signals that initiate the clotting process. Platelet aggregation and clot formation are essential for wound healing and preventing excessive blood loss.
