# Anaphylaxis emergency treatment

[Anaphylaxis](../anaphylaxis/) emergency treatment in a pre-hospital setting:

1. Use an [adrenaline auto-injector](../adrenaline-auto-injector) (brand name EpiPen) and go immediately to a hospital emergency room.

2. Avoid triggers: remove trigger or remove self from triggers.

3. Administer extra doses of H1 and H2 blockers e.g. [ranitidine](../ranitidine)/[cimetidine](../cimetidine/) + [fexofenadine](../fexofenadine)/[hydroxyzine](../hydroxyzine/)/[diphenhydramine](../diphenhydramine/).

4. Administer [corticosteroids](../corticosteroids) because these may prevent prolonged anaphylaxis treatment.

5. Treat H1 reactions (skin and respiratory: mucous overproduction, [asthma](../asthma/), throat tightening, skin itching). Stop asthma attack: [albuterol sulfate](../albuterol-sulfate/), cromolyn nebulized and/or inhaled. Stop cough: cough drops. Clean up mucus: [guaifenesin](../guaifenesin/).

6. Treat H2 reactions (GI and cardiac: sudden diarrhea, gas, bloating, vomiting, nausea, low blood pressure, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feels like you may pass out): Stop H2 reaction: [activated charcoal](../activated-charcoal), [cholestyramine (brand name Questran)](../cholestyramine/), bland food to soak up the irritant and prevent new reactions. Nausea: sea bands. Cardiac symptoms including low blood pressure: [electrolytes](../electrolytes/) and fluids, lay down, assess severity.

7. Manage H3 reactions (neurological: confusion, motor control loss, fatigue, migraine, depression). Reduce likelihood of secondary injury: rest, lay down, do not drive, do not operate heavy machinery. Reduce triggers: breathe clean fresh air; retreat to safe room or environmental containment unit.
