# Allergy testing

Allergy testing is a medical procedure used to identify specific substances or allergens that may trigger an allergic reaction in an individual.

**Common methods**:

* **Skin Prick Test (SPT)**: Apply a small amount of an allergen to the skin, usually on the forearm or back. Prick the skin with a needle to introduce the allergen beneath the skin's surface. If a person is allergic, they develop a small raised bump or hive.

* **Intradermal Test**: Inject a small amount of allergen solution just beneath the surface of the skin. This test is often used when skin prick tests produce inconclusive results.

* **Patch Testing**: Apply small amounts of allergens to patches. Place them on the skin, usually the back. The patches are worn for a specific period, and the skin is observed for any reactions.

* **Blood Tests**: Blood tests, such as the specific IgE blood test, measure the levels of antibodies (immunoglobulin E or IgE) produced in response to specific allergens. This test is often used when skin testing is not preferred.

* **Elimination Diet**: Remove certain foods from the diet, then reintroducing them one at a time to observe any allergic reactions.

* **Provocation Testing**: Expose the patient to suspected allergens in a controlled environment, such as inhaling allergens or consuming them under medical supervision.
