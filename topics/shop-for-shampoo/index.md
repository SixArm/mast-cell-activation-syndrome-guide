# Shop for shampoo

Shampoo recommended by mast cell people. Try to read ingredients lists carefully. You may want to avoid parabans, sulphates such as sodium laurel sulfate, citrus-related ingredients such as citric acid, preservatives such as formaldehyde,  
or other additives such as colors or scents or preservatives. Some patients report better success by rotating i.e. changing the shampoo brand each day or week.
