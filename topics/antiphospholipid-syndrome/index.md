# Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as Hughes syndrome, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. These antibodies can lead to abnormal blood clotting in arteries and veins, as well as a range of other symptoms.

Treatment aims to prevent blood clots and manage the associated symptoms. This may involve anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin or heparin, and other measures to reduce clotting risk.

**Key aspects**:

* **Antiphospholipid Antibodies**: The hallmark of APS is the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. These antibodies can target various phospholipids, a type of lipid molecule found in cell membranes.

* **Hypercoagulability**: People with APS are at an increased risk of abnormal blood clot formation, both in the veins (venous thrombosis) and arteries (arterial thrombosis). This can lead to conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, and heart attacks.

* **Pregnancy Complications**: APS can cause pregnancy-related complications, including recurrent miscarriages, stillbirths, and other issues related to blood clotting in the placental circulation. This is known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in pregnancy.

* **Neuropsychiatric Symptoms**: Some individuals with APS may experience neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive disturbances.

* **Skin Issues**: Skin manifestations can occur, including livedo reticularis (a lacy, purplish discoloration of the skin) and skin ulcers.

* **Cardiovascular Problems**: APS can increase the risk of heart valve disease, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular issues.
