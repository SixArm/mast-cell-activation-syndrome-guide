# Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as Hughes syndrome, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. These antibodies can lead to abnormal blood clotting in arteries and veins, as well as a range of other symptoms.

**Key points**:

* **Hypercoagulability**: People with APS are at an increased risk of abnormal blood clot formation, both in the veins (venous thrombosis) and arteries (arterial thrombosis). This can lead to conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, and heart attacks.

* **Treatment**: Anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin or heparin, reduce clotting risk.

* **Pregnancy Complications**: APS can cause pregnancy-related complications, including recurrent miscarriages, stillbirths, and other issues related to blood clotting in the placental circulation. This is known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in pregnancy.

* **Neuropsychiatric Symptoms**: Some individuals with APS may experience neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive disturbances.

* **Skin Issues**: Skin manifestations can occur, including livedo reticularis (a lacy, purplish discoloration of the skin) and skin ulcers.

* **Cardiovascular Problems**: APS can increase the risk of heart valve disease, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular issues.
