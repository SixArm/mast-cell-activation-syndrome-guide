# Genetic polymorphisms

Genetic polymorphisms, also known as genetic variations or genetic variants, are differences in the DNA sequence among individuals in a population. These variations can involve a single nucleotide change (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), larger insertions of DNA segments or deletions of them, or even structural changes in chromosomes.

**Key points**:

* **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**: SNPs are the most common type of genetic polymorphism. They involve a single base-pair change in the DNA sequence. For example, at a specific position in a gene, one person's DNA might have an "A," while another person's DNA at the same position has a "G."

* **Insertions and Deletions (Indels)**: These polymorphisms involve the insertion or deletion of a small segment of DNA. Indels can cause frame shifts in a gene, potentially leading to altered protein function.

* **Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**: CNVs are genetic polymorphisms that involve the duplication or deletion of larger DNA segments, ranging from a few hundred base pairs to several megabases.

* **Chromosomal Rearrangements**: These polymorphisms involve more extensive structural changes in chromosomes, such as translocations, inversions, and deletions or duplications of entire genes or chromosomal segments. 

* **Functional Consequences**: Many genetic polymorphisms have functional consequences. They can affect gene expression, protein structure and function, and can be associated with a range of traits and disease susceptibilities. Some are benign and have no known impact.

* **Pharmacogenetics**: Genetic polymorphisms play a role in how individuals respond to medications.

* **Genetic Testing**: Genetic testing, including direct-to-consumer genetic testing, is increasingly popular for assessing individual genetic polymorphisms.
