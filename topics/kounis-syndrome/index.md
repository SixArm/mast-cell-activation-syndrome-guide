# Kounis syndrome

Kounis syndrome is a medical condition characterized by the onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in association with an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. It was first described by Greek cardiologist Dr. Nicholas Kounis in 1991.

Kounis syndrome typically occurs when a person with pre-existing coronary artery disease experiences an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, which triggers the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines. These inflammatory substances can lead to spasm of the coronary arteries, causing reduced blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially resulting in symptoms of angina or even myocardial infarction (heart attack).

There are three main variants of Kounis syndrome:

* **Type I is allergic angina**: This occurs in patients without pre-existing coronary artery disease. It involves coronary artery spasm triggered by an allergic reaction, leading to symptoms such as chest pain (angina) and electrocardiographic changes indicative of myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart muscle).

* **Type II is allergic myocardial infarction**: This occurs in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. It involves plaque rupture or erosion triggered by an allergic reaction, leading to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) that obstructs the coronary artery and results in myocardial infarction (heart attack).

* **Type III is coronary artery spasm during anaphylaxis**: This involves coronary artery spasm triggered by severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. It can lead to myocardial ischemia or infarction in patients with or without pre-existing coronary artery disease.

Common triggers of Kounis syndrome include medications (such as antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and contrast agents), insect stings, foods, environmental allergens, and latex. Symptoms of Kounis syndrome may vary depending on the severity of the allergic reaction and the extent of coronary artery involvement but can include chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, and sweating.

Diagnosis of Kounis syndrome typically involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarker testing (such as troponin), and coronary angiography to evaluate coronary artery anatomy and function.

Treatment of Kounis syndrome focuses on managing the underlying allergic reaction, relieving symptoms of myocardial ischemia, and preventing complications such as myocardial infarction. This may include administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, nitroglycerin, and other medications as appropriate. In severe cases, interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be necessary to restore blood flow to the heart muscle.

Prevention of Kounis syndrome involves avoiding known triggers of allergic reactions and ensuring prompt recognition and treatment of allergic emergencies. Individuals with a history of severe allergies or coronary artery disease should carry appropriate medications (such as adrenaline autoinjectors and nitroglycerin) and wear medical alert identification to alert healthcare providers in the event of an allergic reaction or cardiac emergency.
