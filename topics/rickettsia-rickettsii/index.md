# Rickettsia rickettsii

*Rickettsia rickettsii* is the bacterium responsible for causing [Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)](../rocky-mountain-spotted-fever), a potentially severe tick-borne illness. This microorganism is an obligate intracellular pathogen, meaning it can only survive and reproduce within the cells of a host organism. *Rickettsia rickettsii* primarily infects the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, leading to widespread vascular damage and inflammation.

Transmission of *Rickettsia rickettsii* to humans occurs through the bite of infected ticks, specifically the American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), the Rocky Mountain wood tick (*Dermacentor andersoni*), and the brown dog tick (*Rhipicephalus sanguineus*). Once the bacterium enters the human body, it targets and invades endothelial cells, causing them to detach and leading to the characteristic vasculitis seen in RMSF. This infection can result in serious complications, including damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system.

Symptoms of *Rickettsia rickettsii* infection usually appear within 2 to 14 days after a tick bite and include fever, headache, muscle pain, and a distinctive rash. The rash, which begins as small, pink spots, can progress to a more severe form known as petechiae. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical, as untreated RMSF can be fatal. Doxycycline is the preferred antibiotic for treating infections caused by *Rickettsia rickettsii* and is most effective when administered promptly.

Preventing *Rickettsia rickettsii* infections involves avoiding tick-infested areas, using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough tick checks after outdoor activities. Prompt and proper removal of ticks can significantly reduce the risk of infection. Public awareness and education about tick-borne diseases are essential for minimizing the incidence and impact of RMSF.
