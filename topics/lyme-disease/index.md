# Lyme disease

Lyme disease is an infectious illness caused by the bacterium [Borrelia](../borrelia/) burgdorferi. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Lyme disease is more easily treated in its early stages, so prompt medical attention is essential.

**Key points**:

* **Early Symptoms**: Within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite, individuals may experience flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. A characteristic early sign is a circular, red rash with a clear center that resembles a "bull's-eye." This rash is called erythema migrans.

* **Later Symptoms**: Weeks to months later, the disease can progress to later stages, with symptoms that may include severe headaches, joint pain, heart palpitations, and neurological symptoms like facial palsy and memory problems.

* **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of Lyme disease is often based on clinical symptoms and the patient's history of possible tick exposure. Laboratory tests, such as serology tests to detect antibodies to the bacterium, can support the diagnosis.

* **Treatment**: Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. Early treatment with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin, is highly effective and usually results in a full recovery. The choice of antibiotic and the duration of treatment depend on the stage of the disease and individual factors.

* **Prevention**: Preventing Lyme disease primarily involves avoiding tick bites. This can be done by wearing long clothing, using insect repellent, conducting tick checks after spending time outdoors, and reducing tick populations around homes and recreational areas.
