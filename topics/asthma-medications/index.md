# Asthma medications

Asthma often involves a combination of medications, including those that provide immediate relief (rescue medications) and those that control inflammation and prevent symptoms (controller medications). 

**Common types**:

* **Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs)**: These bronchodilators provide quick relief by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways, allowing for improved airflow. They are commonly used for acute symptoms and are often referred to as rescue inhalers. Examples: Albuterol, Levalbuterol.

* **Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABAs)**: These provide bronchodilation and are used for long-term asthma control. They are often prescribed in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for individuals with persistent asthma. Examples: Salmeterol, Formoterol.

* **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)**: These are anti-inflammatory medications that reduce airway inflammation, making them a key component of asthma management. They are often used as controller medications to prevent symptoms and exacerbations. Examples: Fluticasone, Budesonide, Beclomethasone.

* **Leukotriene Modifiers**: These block the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators. They are used as additional controller medications, especially in individuals with exercise-induced asthma or allergic rhinitis. Examples: Montelukast, Zafirlukast.

* **Mast Cell Stabilizers**: These prevent the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells. They are used as controller medications and are particularly helpful for individuals with exercise-induced asthma. Examples: Cromolyn, Nedocromil.

* **Monoclonal Antibodies**: These are biologic medications that target specific components of the immune system involved in asthma inflammation. They are used in severe, uncontrolled asthma and are typically administered by injection. Examples: Omalizumab, Mepolizumab, Dupilumab, Benralizumab.

* **Oral Corticosteroids**: Oral corticosteroids may be prescribed for short periods to control severe asthma exacerbations. Long-term use is avoided due to the risk of side effects. Examples: Prednisone, Prednisolone.
