# Asthma medications

[Asthma](../asthma/) often involves a combination of medications, some for immediate relief (i.e. rescue medications/), and some for long-term management of inflammation (i.e. controller medications).

**Common types**:

* **Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs)**: These bronchodilators provide quick relief by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways. They treat acute symptoms and are known as rescue medications. Examples: Albuterol, Levalbuterol.

* **Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABAs)**: These bronchodilators provide long-term asthma control. They are often prescribed in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for individuals with persistent asthma. Examples: Salmeterol, Formoterol.

* **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)**: These reduce airway inflammation. They are controller medications to prevent symptoms. Examples: Fluticasone, Budesonide, Beclomethasone.

* **Oral Corticosteroids**: Oral corticosteroids for short periods can control severe asthma exacerbations. Long-term use is avoided due to the risk of side effects. Examples: Prednisone, Prednisolone.

* **Leukotriene Modifiers**: These block the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators. They are controller medications, especially for exercise-induced asthma or allergic rhinitis. Examples: Montelukast, Zafirlukast.

* **Mast Cell Stabilizers**: These prevent the release of histamine and inflammatory substances from mast cells. They are controller medications, especially for exercise-induced asthma. Examples: Cromolyn, Nedocromil.

* **Monoclonal Antibodies**: These are biologic medications for severe asthma that target components of the immune system. Examples: Omalizumab, Mepolizumab, Dupilumab, Benralizumab.
