# Bone marrow biopsy

A bone marrow biopsy is a medical procedure in which a small sample of bone marrow tissue is extracted for examination. The bone marrow is the spongy tissue found within the cavities of certain bones, such as the hipbone, sternum (breastbone), and the long bones of the arms and legs.

This procedure is typically performed by a hematologist, oncologist, or a specially trained healthcare provider.

* Local anesthesia is administered to numb the skin and underlying tissue, usually at the biopsy site. A special needle is inserted through the skin and into the bone, and a syringe is used to aspirate (draw out) a small amount of liquid bone marrow. A larger, hollow needle is used to obtain a small core of bone marrow tissue. This may cause some pressure or brief discomfort.

* The collected samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis by pathologists and other specialists. Most patients can resume normal activities shortly after. There may be some discomfort at the biopsy site for a day or two.

Bone marrow biopsies are performed for various purposes, including:

* **Diagnosis**: A bone marrow biopsy may be conducted to diagnose and evaluate a wide range of conditions, such as blood disorders (e.g., anemia, leukemia, lymphoma), bone marrow disorders, and certain infectious diseases.

* **Staging and Monitoring**: In individuals already diagnosed with conditions like leukemia or lymphoma, a bone marrow biopsy can help determine the extent of the disease and monitor treatment response.

* **Identification of Cytogenetic Abnormalities**: The bone marrow sample can be used to analyze the genetic and chromosomal characteristics of the bone marrow cells, which can be important for treatment decisions and prognosis.
