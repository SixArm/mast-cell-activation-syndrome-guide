The “trifecta” refers to three conditions that commonly occur together: Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS).

These three conditions are gradually becoming more recognized in the mainstream medical world as more and more patients find themselves struggling with debilitating and often mysterious symptoms. However, recognizing these conditions is only the first step on the healing journey. With the right approach and toolbox, patients can reverse many of these symptoms to find lasting vitality.

Written by a Doctor of Physical Therapy who has additional certifications in functional medicine and nutrition and extensive experience in working with these conditions, this book serves as patient guide that empowers individuals to put all of the puzzle pieces together as part of an individualized healing plan.

Part One (3 chapters) is an overview of the three trifecta conditions, and Part Two (9 chapters) outlines the important pillars of an essential plan to address any (or all) of these conditions holistically. The book wraps up with a chapter of patient case stories.
