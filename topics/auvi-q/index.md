# Auvi-Q

Auvi-Q is a brand name for an [adrenaline auto-injector](../adrenaline-auto-injector/) used to treat severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It delivers a single dose of adrenaline quickly and easily in emergency situations when an individual experiences symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives, or a rapid drop in blood pressure.

The Auvi-Q device is compact and portable, designed for ease of use by individuals experiencing an allergic reaction or by their caregivers. It features voice-guided instructions that walk users through the injection process step by step, helping to ensure proper administration even in stressful situations. Additionally, the device has a retractable needle mechanism, which reduces the risk of accidental needle sticks after use.

Adrenaline, the medication delivered by Auvi-Q, works by rapidly constricting blood vessels and relaxing airway muscles, reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis and improving breathing and blood pressure. Prompt administration of adrenaline is essential during an allergic reaction to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.

Auvi-Q is available in different dosage strengths to accommodate various age groups and body weights, including pediatric and adult formulations. It is prescribed by healthcare providers for individuals with known severe allergies to specific triggers, such as food, insect stings, medications, or latex.
