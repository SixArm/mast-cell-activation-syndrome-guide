# Start here for safe foods

"Safe foods" is the nickname for foods that someone can eat that don't cause symptoms. Safe foods can be different for each person, and can change over time.

**Try these first**:

* **Golden Delicious Apples.** Wash thoroughly or peel.

* **Egg yolks.** Ideally free-range. Egg whites may cause reactions.

* **Boiled Chicken.** Ideally free-range, and fresh or flash-frozen.

* **Boiled Salmon.** Ideally wild-caught, and fresh or flash-frozen.

* **Rice.** Ideally basmati rice or jasmine rice.

* **Sweet potatoes.**

* **Cucumbers.**

* **Popcorn.** Ideally air pop. No microwave bags.

* **Coconut water.** Ideally without pulp.

* **Gluten-Free Oatmeal.** Be aware oat avenin protein is similar to gluten, so may cause reactions. Be aware oats can carry mold.

**Tips**:

* **Maximize quality**: Seek organic, locally-grown, GMO-free.

* **Minimize factory farming**: Prefer free range and/or grass-fed.

* **Minimize delays**: Buy and cook the same day, or buy pre-frozen.

* **No additives**: Such as colors, flavors, hormones, preservatives.
