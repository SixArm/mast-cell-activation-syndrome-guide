# N-methylhistamine test

The N-methylhistamine test is a diagnostic tool used to measure the levels of N-methylhistamine in urine or blood. N-methylhistamine is a metabolite of histamine, a chemical released by mast cells during allergic and inflammatory responses. Elevated levels of N-methylhistamine may indicate increased histamine activity in the body, which can be associated with conditions such as mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

**Overview:**

* **Purpose:** The primary purpose of measuring N-methylhistamine is to assess the activity of mast cells. Mast cells release histamine, which is then metabolized in the body to form N-methylhistamine.

* **Procedure:** N-methylhistamine levels can be measured in urine or blood samples. Urine is often used for this test because histamine metabolites are excreted in the urine.

* **Interpretation:** Elevated levels of N-methylhistamine may suggest increased histamine activity, but like other mast cell mediator tests, the interpretation should be considered in context.

* **Variations:** In addition to measuring N-methylhistamine, healthcare providers may also consider evaluating other histamine metabolites to get a more comprehensive picture of mast cell activity.
