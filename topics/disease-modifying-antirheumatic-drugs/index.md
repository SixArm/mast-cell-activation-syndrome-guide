# Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a category of medications specifically designed to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by altering the underlying disease process rather than just alleviating symptoms. Unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids, which primarily target inflammation and pain, DMARDs aim to slow the progression of the disease and prevent joint and tissue damage. This makes them a critical component in the long-term management of rheumatic conditions.

There are two main types of DMARDs: traditional (or conventional) DMARDs and biologic DMARDs. Traditional DMARDs, such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine, work by broadly suppressing the immune system to reduce inflammation. These drugs are typically the first line of treatment for many autoimmune conditions due to their effectiveness and relatively lower cost. However, they can take several weeks to months to exhibit their full therapeutic effects.

Biologic DMARDs, such as etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab, are more targeted therapies. They are engineered to inhibit specific components of the immune system, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL) pathways, which play a key role in the inflammatory process. Biologics are often prescribed when traditional DMARDs are insufficient or cause intolerable side effects. While highly effective, biologics can be expensive and may increase the risk of infections due to their immunosuppressive action.

The use of DMARDs requires regular monitoring by healthcare professionals to manage potential side effects and adjust dosages appropriately. This careful management helps to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing risks, enabling patients with autoimmune diseases to maintain better quality of life.
