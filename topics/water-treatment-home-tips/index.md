# Water treatment home tips

Water treatment at home uses a water filter. Here are tips that may help you.

**Testing**:

* If you have an aquarium shop close, you can tell them you are thinking of setting up an aquarium tank

* Take a clean glass bottle of water that has come from the closest source of your water main, and a clean glass bottle of water from your kitchen tap. The two samples can check for an isolated problem with your pipes.

* You at least want to know pH, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates. This will straight up off the bat let you know if your water is appropriate for you to drink.

**Installation**:

* Ideally get a 3 stage filtration system, or better, at least for your drinking water. Ideally go below 4 microns, because thatâ€™s when the filter protects you from chlorine and chloramines.

* If you are installing an under-sink water filter, and you don't want to drill through your sink top, then here's a tip: if you know someone with a 3D printer, then you can ask them to print you a filter mounting bracket that can go under your sink. This is handy for people who rent or who move often.
