# Fluoxetine

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and certain eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation, in the brain. By inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, fluoxetine helps improve mood, reduce anxiety, and alleviate symptoms of OCD. Brand name: Prozac.

Fluoxetine is typically taken orally in the form of capsules, tablets, or liquid, with the dosage varying based on the condition being treated and the patient's response. It is often prescribed to be taken once daily, either in the morning or evening. The medication may take several weeks to achieve its full therapeutic effect, and patients are advised to continue taking it as directed even if they do not notice immediate improvement.

Common side effects of fluoxetine include nausea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Most side effects are mild and tend to diminish over time. However, fluoxetine can also cause more serious side effects, such as increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in young adults and adolescents. Therefore, close monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential during the initial treatment period and when adjusting dosages.

Fluoxetine's efficacy in treating a range of mental health conditions, along with its relatively favorable side effect profile, makes it a widely used and valuable medication in psychiatric practice. However, individual responses can vary, and ongoing assessment and adjustment by healthcare providers are crucial to ensuring optimal treatment outcomes.
