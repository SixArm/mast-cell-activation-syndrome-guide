# Biofilm busters

Biofilm busters are substances or compounds that are capable of disrupting or breaking down biofilms. Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, etc.) that adhere to surfaces and are encapsulated within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These biofilms can form on a wide range of surfaces, including medical devices, implants, teeth, and industrial equipment, and they can cause various problems, such as infections, fouling, and corrosion.

**Examples**:

* **Enzymes**: Certain enzymes, such as DNase (deoxyribonuclease) and dispersin B, can degrade the extracellular DNA and polysaccharides that make up the biofilm matrix.
  
* **Antimicrobial Agents**: Some antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, and quorum sensing inhibitors, can target and kill the microorganisms within the biofilm.

* **Chelating Agents**: Chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citric acid, can bind to metal ions that are essential for biofilm formation and growth.

* **Surfactants**: Surfactants are compounds that can disrupt biofilm structure by reducing surface tension and breaking up the biofilm matrix.

* **Natural Products**: Some natural products, such as essential oils, plant extracts, and microbial metabolites, can break down biofilms via enzymatic degradation, antimicrobial activity, or interference with quorum sensing.

* **Physical Methods**: Physical methods, such as ultrasonication, mechanical agitation, or high-pressure water jets, can be used to physically disrupt or remove biofilms from surfaces.
