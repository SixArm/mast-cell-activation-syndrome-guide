# RealTime Laboratories mycotoxin mold tests

The RealTime total mycotoxin panel tests for the presence of 16 of the most common and toxic mycotoxins produced by indoor mold contaminants. RealTime offers complimentary physician consultations with a RealTime medical consultant to help explain patient result. RealTime offers complimentary patient consultations with the RealTime Patient Navigator to help people understand their results.

## Dr. Neil Nathan recommendation

Dr. Neil Nathan explains that he has found that the RealTime test, with proper preparation, gives him the most accurate and useful results. Sometimes he supplements it with the test from Mosaic as well, which uses a different technology. He has experience with all four labs and has run thousands of tests. He doesn't accept money from any of the labs.

Dr. Nathan uses the testing to make better decisions with binders, and to help determine, during the detoxing process, whether the patient will or will not need to be treated with anti-fungal medications.
