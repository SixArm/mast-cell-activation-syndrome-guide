# Colestipol

Colestipol is a medication used primarily to lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. Brand name: Colestid.

It belongs to the class of drugs known as [bile acid sequestrants](../bile-acid-sequestrants/), similar to [cholestyramine](../cholestyramine/) and [colesevelam](../colesevelam/). Like other bile acid sequestrants, colestipol works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, preventing their reabsorption and leading to increased excretion in the feces. This triggers the liver to produce more bile acids from cholesterol, thus reducing cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.

Colestipol is typically taken orally in tablet or powder form, usually mixed with water or another liquid. It's often prescribed in conjunction with dietary and lifestyle changes to help manage high cholesterol levels.

Common side effects of colestipol may include constipation, bloating, gas, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. As with any medication, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and to discuss any concerns or potential side effects.
