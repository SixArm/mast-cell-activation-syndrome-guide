# Free Thyroxine (FT4) test

The Free Thyroxine (FT4) test measures the level of free thyroxine in the blood, an important thyroid hormone. Unlike total thyroxine, which includes both bound and unbound hormone, FT4 specifically measures the unbound, biologically active form. Thyroxine (T4) is produced by the thyroid gland and plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, growth, and development.

The FT4 test is commonly used to assess thyroid function and diagnose thyroid disorders. It is often ordered alongside the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test. Elevated levels of FT4 can indicate hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive, producing excess thyroid hormones. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. Conversely, low levels of FT4 may suggest hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland is underactive, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and depression.

The test involves a simple blood draw, and the results are typically available within a few days. Interpretation of FT4 levels depends on the context provided by TSH levels and clinical symptoms. In some cases, additional tests such as Fread or thyroid antibody tests may be needed for a comprehensive evaluation.

Accurate measurement of FT4 is essential for the proper management of thyroid disorders. Treatment decisions, including the use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy or antithyroid medications, often rely on FT4 levels. Regular monitoring helps ensure that thyroid hormone levels remain within the optimal range, allowing for effective management of thyroid-related conditions.
