# Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet

Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is a specialized version of the paleo diet designed to help individuals with autoimmune diseases manage their symptoms and improve their overall health. It focuses on removing potentially inflammatory foods while emphasizing nutrient-dense, healing foods to support the immune system and reduce inflammation in the body.

**Key aspects**:

* **Eliminate Potential Triggers**: Grains (such as wheat, barley, oats), legumes (such as beans and peanuts), dairy products, processed foods, refined sugars, vegetable oils, eggs, nightshade vegetables (such as tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants), nuts, seeds, and certain spices.

* **Emphasize Nutrient-Dense Foods**: Vegetables (except nightshades), fruits, quality meats (grass-fed beef, pastured poultry, wild-caught fish), organ meats, bone broth, seafood, healthy fats (such as olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil), and fermented foods (such as sauerkraut and kombucha).

* **Focus on Gut Health**: Encourage gut-healing foods such as bone broth, collagen, and fermented foods to support digestive function and reduce intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"), which is believed to contribute to autoimmune disease.

* **Reintroduce Step By Step**: After a period of strict elimination, reintroduce eliminated foods one at a time to assess their tolerance and identify potential triggers of symptoms.
