# Sinus cleanse notes

TODO

Today my new ear-nose-throat doctor found the nasal infection I have had for
nearly five years. Before this I saw five other doctors who all said I had no
infection and refused to treat me. 

At first this doctor couldn't find the infection, but they believed me. They
told me to use a cream in my nose. Unfortunately the infection was in the very
back of the nasal cavity so the cream wasn‚Äôt getting to it. After getting on a
GI steroid recently my immune system was repressed enough for the staph to
overtake my nose. Very scary but got me the correct antibiotic finally.

Realizing fully that I was right propelled me to find the energy again to
research. I found a stanford study that said most is harbored in the
Sphenoethmoidal recess. I am an anatomist so this was about where I have been
clawing at through my mouth for a year. So I told the dr to look exactly there
and he found puss still remaining after 10 days of antibiotics. 

This is as good as my face has been for five years so I know its been there the
whole time. I am doing more antibiotics now and an antibiotic sinus rinse. 

Since starting the first round of oral antibiotics my mcas and allergies are in
remission. I now realized that MCAS has been a gift. My mast cells have been
preventing the infection from spreading, keeping me alive until someone would
treat me. The mast cells are my saviors not my enemies. 

I still for sure have MCAS because I've had flairs for many years, but my MCAS
was mild and not chronic until this infection happened. And now I am medicated
so I think without an infection and medications I have a great shot at full
remission. 

For the first time in 25 years I am not reacting to grass. I gardened this
weekend for the first time in my life. Its pretty fun when it doesnt make you
sick it turns out. I am removing the wild grass and planting herbs I can eat. So
even if this is not permanent I will benefit years to come. It‚Äôs the mint plant
of hope.

Before surgery I would request that they scope every area. Be specific and say
"middle meatus" and "superior meatus" and "sphenoethmoid recess". Then you‚Äôll
know the doctor looked in all corners of the nasal passage. 

Have you gotten a ct scan lately? Is there any fluid? Even if half full in
people like us it could be a chronic sinus infection. The surgery ents who dont
do allergies only look for acute infections. My allergist said I just saw many
of the wrong kind of ents.


Yeah I thought it was a sinus infection for me. But they have been open and
clear for over a year. It was a small indent right by the opening of the
sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses, but still in the nose. So glad you got your
daughter help. No one should have to experience this, especially a child!


you can do the flush with whatever antiseptics you are already using. Learn how
to position your head to get into every sinus cavity. Basically you have to lean
your head back for some of them and then go completely forward almost upside
down for the rest. I hold my nose while switching positions.

I usually do it on my bed and lay on my back with my head off the bed. I very
slowly fill up the sinuses in this position. Wait 2 minutes.

Then I plug my nose with my fingers and turn over onto my belly kind of
shimmying off the bed til my head hits the floor and unplug- that gets into the
sinuses in our forehead. Wait 2 minutes. 

This technique is not for everyone but it sure does get everywhere into the
sinus cavities. I keep a towel right by too and when I come back up I just let
all of the liquid drain onto the towel. Most of it comes out quickly but
sometimes you‚Äôll get delayed emptying for up to 30 min later.


there are a few, i‚Äôd nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine, completely wipes
things out up thereüëåüèΩ Type of pathogen

Antibiotics can‚Äôt work if the opening to a cavity is swelled shut. Antibiotics
need oxygen to work. When my daughter was little she‚Äôd had non-stop sinus
infections that wouldn‚Äôt respond to antibiotics. She was classified as having
serious sinus disease at 5! I went from Dr to Dr trying to get one to
investigate her sinuses surgically but no one would because it could stunt her
nose growth. I finally got an ENT to go in and flush her sinuses. He agreed and
found one swelled shut but got his instrument thru and said he washed a lot of
gross stuff out. That night the poor little thing said - Mommy, I didn‚Äôt know it
wasn‚Äôt supposed to hurt to breath. Broke my heart it took so long. She‚Äôs never
had a sinus infection since and she‚Äôs 30.
