# Vitamin B1 = Thiamine

Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is one of the eight B-vitamins essential for various bodily functions. Thiamine plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, as it is a coenzyme necessary for the conversion of carbohydrates into energy. It also helps maintain proper functioning of the nervous system.

**Key points:**

* **Energy Metabolism:** Thiamine is a coenzyme involved in several enzymatic reactions that help convert carbohydrates into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the body's primary source of energy.

* **Nervous System Function:** Thiamine is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It plays a role in nerve signal transmission and can help protect nerve cells.

* **Cardiovascular Health:** Thiamine is associated with cardiovascular health and may help reduce the risk of heart diseases.

* **Mental Function:** Thiamine deficiency can lead to cognitive impairments and memory problems, including a condition known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

* **Red Blood Cell Formation:** It is also involved in the production of red blood cells.

Dietary sources of thiamine include whole grains, enriched cereals, beans, nuts, lean pork, and yeast. Thiamine is water-soluble, meaning that it is not stored in the body, and excess amounts are excreted in the urine.

Thiamine deficiency can lead to a condition known as beriberi, which is characterized by symptoms such as muscle weakness, nerve damage, and difficulty with basic bodily functions.
