# Zinc

Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in the development and function of immune cells, as well as roles in tissue repair, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is important for growth, especially in children, and for the development of sexual organs during puberty. Zinc is necessary for normal taste and smell perception. 

Key points:

* Dietary Sources: Zinc is naturally found in a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, seafood (especially oysters), dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains. It is also added to certain foods as a nutritional supplement.

* Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults: 11 milligrams for men and 8 milligrams for women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women may require higher amounts.

* Cofactor: Many enzymes in the body require zinc as a cofactor to facilitate various chemical reactions.

* Supplements: Zinc supplements are commonly used to treat zinc deficiency or certain health conditions that may require zinc supplementation, such as diarrhea, macular degeneration, or sickle cell disease.

* Deficiency: Zinc deficiency can lead to various health issues, including impaired immune function, growth retardation, skin problems, and delayed wound healing.

* Toxicity: Excessive intake of zinc can lead to toxicity, resulting in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, neurological symptoms. It is important to avoid taking excessive doses of zinc supplements.
