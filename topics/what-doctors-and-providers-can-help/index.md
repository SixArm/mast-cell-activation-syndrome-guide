* Rheumatologists: Some rheumatologists have experience in diagnosing and treating MCAS, as it can involve systemic inflammatory reactions. They can assess and manage symptoms, especially those affecting joints and connective tissues.

* Hematologists: Hematologists specialize in blood disorders, and some are familiar with MCAS, as it can involve abnormal blood cell counts and clotting issues. They can help manage these aspects of the condition.

* Gastroenterologists: MCAS can impact the digestive system, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea. Gastroenterologists can help assess and manage gastrointestinal symptoms associated with MCAS.

* Dermatologists: Skin-related symptoms and conditions can be a part of MCAS. Dermatologists can help with the diagnosis and management of skin manifestations.
