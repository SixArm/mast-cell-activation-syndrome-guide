# What doctors and providers can help?

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) can be complex, and it often requires healthcare providers who specialize in this rare and relatively newly-recognized condition.

Here are some types of healthcare providers who can help:

* Primary Care Physicians: Your primary care doctor can serve as the first point of contact and may refer you to specialists for further evaluation and management.

* Allergists/Immunologists: These specialists often have expertise in diagnosing and managing immune system disorders and allergies. They can help assess your symptoms, perform tests to identify MCAS, and develop treatment plans.

* Rheumatologists: Some rheumatologists have experience in diagnosing and treating systemic inflammatory reactions, and especially ones affecting joints and connective tissues.

* Hematologists: Hematologists specialize in blood disorders, and some are familiar with MCAS, as it can involve abnormal blood cell counts and clotting issues.

* Gastroenterologists: MCAS can impact the digestive system, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea. Gastroenterologists can help assess and manage gastrointestinal symptoms associated with MCAS.

* Dermatologists: Skin-related symptoms and conditions can be a part of MCAS. Dermatologists can help with the diagnosis and management of skin manifestations.

* Mast Cell Disorder Specialists: These experts have in-depth knowledge and experience in diagnosing and managing conditions like MCAS.
