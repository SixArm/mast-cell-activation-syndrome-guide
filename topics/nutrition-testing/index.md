# Nutrition testing

Nutrition testing involves assessing an individual's nutritional status to identify potential deficiencies or imbalances in essential nutrients. This type of testing can provide valuable insights into an individual's overall health and help tailor dietary recommendations or interventions.

**Examples**:

* **Iron**: Measure iron levels, transferrin, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).

* **Vitamin D**: Measure vitamin D in the blood, which is important for bone health and immune function.

* **Vitamin B12 and Folate**: Assess levels of vitamin B12 and folate, essential for red blood cell formation and neurological function.

* **Omega-3 Fatty Acid**: Measure omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) in the blood, which are crucial for cardiovascular and brain health.

* **Amino Acids**: Evaluate the levels of individual amino acids in the blood, providing insights into protein metabolism.

* **Nutrigenomics**: Analyze genetic variations that may impact nutrient metabolism and nutrient utilization.

* **Food Sensitivities**: Identifies specific foods that may trigger immune responses or sensitivities.

* **Body Composition**: Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), or skinfold caliper measurements can provide information about body fat percentage, lean muscle mass, and body composition.

* **Micronutrients**: Evaluate levels of various micronutrients in the blood, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

* **Functional Testing**: Assess gut health, hormone levels, and metabolic markers to identify underlying factors that could impact nutrition.
