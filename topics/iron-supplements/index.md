# Iron supplements

Iron supplements are dietary supplements that contain iron, a vital mineral essential for various physiological functions in the body. Iron plays a crucial role in the formation of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. 

**Key points**:

**Purpose**: Iron supplements are commonly used to prevent or treat iron deficiency, a condition characterized by low levels of iron in the body. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, a condition in which there are insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin to adequately oxygenate tissues, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

* **Forms**: Iron supplements are available in various forms, including ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and iron polysaccharide complex. These formulations contain different amounts of elemental iron, which is the actual amount of iron available for absorption by the body. Ferrous sulfate is the most common form of iron supplement and is widely used due to its high bioavailability and low cost.

* **Dosage**: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron varies by age and sex, with adult males typically requiring around 8 milligrams (mg) per day and adult females requiring around 18 mg per day (increasing to 27 mg per day during pregnancy). However, individual needs may vary, and higher doses may be recommended for individuals with iron deficiency anemia or other medical conditions.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects of iron supplements may include gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps. These side effects can often be minimized by taking iron supplements with food or adjusting the dosage. In some cases, iron supplements may cause darkening of the stool or temporary staining of the teeth.

* **Safety**: While iron supplements are generally safe when used as directed, excessive iron intake can lead to toxicity and adverse health effects. Iron poisoning, particularly in children, can cause serious symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, and in severe cases, organ damage or death.
