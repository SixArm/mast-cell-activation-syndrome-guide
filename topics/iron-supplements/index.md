# Iron supplements

Iron supplements are dietary supplements that contain iron. Iron is a vital mineral essential for the body's formation of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: To treat iron deficiency or anemia, a condition in which there are insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin to adequately oxygenate tissues, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

* **Forms**: Iron supplements are available in various forms, including ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and iron polysaccharide complex. Ferrous sulfate is the most common form of iron supplement and is widely used due to its high bioavailability and low cost.

* **Dosage**: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 8 milligrams (mg) per day for adult males, and 18 mg per day for adult females (increasing to 27 mg per day during pregnancy).

* **Side Effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps. These side effects can often be minimized by taking iron supplements with food or adjusting the dosage. In some cases, iron supplements may cause darkening of the stool or temporary staining of the teeth.

* **Safety**:Excessive iron intake can lead to toxicity and adverse health effects. Iron poisoning, particularly in children, can cause serious symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, lethargy, and in severe cases, organ damage or death.
