# Ginger

Ginger has been used for its medicinal properties for centuries. It contains various bioactive compounds, including gingerols, shogaols, and paradols, which are believed to contribute to its health benefits.

Ginger supplements are dietary supplements that contain concentrated forms of ginger extract, derived from the rhizome (underground stem) of the Zingiber officinale plant. These supplements typically come in the form of capsules, tablets, softgels, or liquid extracts.
