# Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)

Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. It is an essential nutrient, meaning the human body cannot produce it on its own.

**Key points**:

* **Antioxidant properties**: Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which means it helps protect cells from oxidative damage.

* **Immune support**: Vitamin C helps stimulate the production of white blood cells, enhances the function of immune cells, and helps defend against infections.

* **Collagen production**: Vitamin C essential for collagen, wound healing, skin health, bone health, and tissue health.

* **Absorption of iron**: Vitamin C enhances the digestive absorption of non-heme iron (the type of iron found in plant-based foods). This helps prevent iron-deficiency anemia.

* **Neurotransmitter synthesis**: Vitamin C helps the synthesis of neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine.

* **Skin health**: Vitamin C is used in skincare products to promote healthy skin and reduce signs of aging.

* **Dietary sources**: Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, berries, kiwi, guava, papaya, green peppers, and broccoli.

* **Deficiency**: Severe deficiency leads to scurvy, fatigue, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, and skin conditions.

* **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**: 65-90 milligrams per day for adults. Higher during pregnancy and lactation.

* **Forms**: Ascorbic acid is generally good for individuals with histamine intolerance. Sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are better for people who have stomach irritation.
