# BRAT diet

The BRAT diet, which stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast, is a bland-food diet commonly recommended for individuals experiencing gastrointestinal distress, such as diarrhea or vomiting. These foods are chosen because they are easy to digest, low in fiber, and help to firm up stools.

* **Bananas** provide important nutrients like potassium, which is often depleted during episodes of diarrhea or vomiting. They also contain pectin, a type of soluble fiber that can help absorb liquid in the intestines and slow down diarrhea.

* **Rice** is low in fiber and easy on the stomach, providing a good source of carbohydrates to help maintain energy levels without irritating the digestive system.

* **Applesauce** is easy to digest and provides pectin, similar to bananas. Additionally, applesauce offers a mild sweetness that can be soothing and palatable for those with reduced appetite due to illness.

* **Toast** is bland and easy to digest. It helps to provide bulk to the stool and is unlikely to cause further irritation to an already sensitive digestive tract.
