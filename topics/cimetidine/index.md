# Cimetidine

Cimetidine is an antihistamine medication belonging to a class of drugs known as H2 receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers. It works by blocking the action of histamine on the stomach cells, thereby reducing the production of stomach acid. Brand name: Tagamet HB.

Cimetidine is primarily used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It helps relieve symptoms such as heartburn, acid indigestion, and stomach pain caused by excess stomach acid.

In addition to its effects on the stomach, cimetidine also has other actions in the body, including blocking the action of histamine at other sites, which can lead to its use in the treatment of conditions like urticaria (hives) and certain types of gastric tumors.

Cimetidine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and by prescription in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid formulations. It's generally taken orally, either with or without food, as directed by a healthcare provider.

Like any medication, cimetidine may cause side effects in some individuals, including headache, dizziness, diarrhea, and constipation. It may also interact with other medications, so it's essential to discuss any existing medical conditions and medications with a doctor before starting cimetidine.
