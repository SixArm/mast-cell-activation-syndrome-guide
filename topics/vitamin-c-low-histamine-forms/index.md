# Vitamin C: low-histamine forms

For individuals with histamine intolerance or sensitivity, certain forms of vitamin C may be preferred as they are considered lower in histamine.

**Key forms:**

* Ascorbic Acid (Pure Vitamin C): Ascorbic acid is the most common and purest form of vitamin C. It is generally well-tolerated by individuals with histamine intolerance.

* Sodium Ascorbate: Sodium ascorbate is a buffered form of vitamin C that is less acidic than ascorbic acid. It is often recommended for individuals who may experience stomach irritation with ascorbic acid.

* Calcium Ascorbate: This is another buffered form of vitamin C that includes calcium. Like sodium ascorbate, it is less acidic and may be gentler on the stomach.

While the above forms of vitamin C are generally considered lower in histamine, individual responses can vary, and it's advisable to introduce them cautiously to observe any potential reactions.
