# Anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies

TODO

Anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies are a class of biologic drugs designed to treat severe eosinophilic asthma and other eosinophil-associated conditions by targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5), a cytokine crucial for the growth, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in inflammatory processes and allergic reactions.

One of the prominent anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies is mepolizumab, marketed under the brand name Nucala. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5, preventing it from interacting with its receptor on the surface of eosinophils. This action reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and tissues, thereby decreasing inflammation and preventing asthma exacerbations.

Mepolizumab is administered via subcutaneous injection, typically every four weeks. It is specifically indicated for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who have a high eosinophil count and whose symptoms are not adequately controlled with standard inhaled corticosteroids and other maintenance therapies. Other anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies include reslizumab (Cinqair), administered intravenously, and benralizumab (Fasenra), administered subcutaneously and targeting the IL-5 receptor directly.

These therapies have shown significant efficacy in reducing the frequency of asthma attacks, improving lung function, and enhancing the quality of life for patients. Common side effects are generally mild and may include injection site reactions, headache, and back pain, though more serious reactions are rare.

Overall, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies offer a targeted approach to managing severe eosinophilic asthma and related conditions. By specifically reducing eosinophil levels, these therapies address a key underlying cause of inflammation, providing relief for patients with otherwise difficult-to-control symptoms.
