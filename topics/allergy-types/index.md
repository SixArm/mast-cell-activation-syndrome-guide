# Allergy types

Allergies are a common and chronic condition in which the immune system reacts to substances that are typically harmless. These substances, known as allergens, can trigger an allergic response in sensitive individuals.

Common types of allergies includeâ€¦

Respiratory Allergies:

* Hay Fever (Allergic Rhinitis): Allergic reactions to airborne allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. Symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and coughing.

* Asthma: Allergens, infections, or irritants can trigger asthma symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.

* Allergic Bronchitis: An allergic reaction in the bronchial tubes can lead to coughing, increased mucus production, and chest discomfort.

Food Allergies:

* Common food allergens include nuts, eggs, milk, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Allergic reactions to these foods can range from mild hives to severe anaphylaxis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.

Skin Allergies:

* Contact Dermatitis: Skin allergies can result from contact with allergens such as poison ivy, latex, or certain skincare products, leading to redness, itching, and a rash.

* Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema): This is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin, often related to allergic triggers.

Insect Sting Allergies:

* Some individuals may have severe allergic reactions to insect stings or bites, such as from bees, wasps, or ants. Symptoms can include swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.

Medication Allergies:

* Allergic reactions to medications, such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or aspirin, can range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.

Latex Allergy:

* Latex allergy can be triggered by exposure to latex-containing products, such as gloves or balloons. Symptoms may include skin reactions or respiratory problems.
