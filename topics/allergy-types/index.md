# Allergy types

Allergies are a common chronic condition in which the immune system reacts to substances that are typically harmless. Reactions can range from a rash to hives to severe anaphylaxis.

**Common types**:

* **Hay fever (allergic rhinitis)**: It is triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen. Symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and coughing.

* **Asthma**: Allergens, infections, or irritants can trigger wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.

* **Allergic bronchitis**: It is a reaction in the bronchial tubes that can lead to coughing, mucus production, and chest discomfort.

* **Food allergies**: These can be triggered by common food allergens such as nuts, eggs, milk, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

* **Insect sting allergies**: These can be triggered by stings or bites, such as from bees, wasps, or ants. Symptoms can include swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.

* **Medication allergies**: Antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or aspirin, can trigger symptoms

* **Latex allergy**: This can be triggered by exposure to latex-containing products, such as gloves or balloons. Symptoms may include skin reactions or respiratory problems.

* **Contact dermatitis**: This is when contact with environmental allergens can cause redness, itching, and a rash.

* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema)**: This is chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin, often related to allergic triggers.
