# Allergy types

Allergies are a common and chronic condition in which the immune system reacts to substances that are typically harmless. These substances, known as allergens, can trigger an allergic response in sensitive individuals.

Common allergy types:

* Hay fever (allergic rhinitis) is triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen. Symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and coughing.

* Asthma: Allergens, infections, or irritants can trigger wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.

* Allergic bronchitis is an allergic reaction in the bronchial tubes that can lead to coughing, increased mucus production, and chest discomfort.

* Food allergies can be triggered by common food allergens such as nuts, eggs, milk, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. Symptoms range from mild hives to severe anaphylaxis, which is potentially fatal.

* Insect sting allergies can be triggered by stings or bites, such as from bees, wasps, or ants. Symptoms can include swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.

* Medication allergy can be triggered by antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or aspirin. Symptoms range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.

* Latex allergy can be triggered by exposure to latex-containing products, such as gloves or balloons. Symptoms may include skin reactions or respiratory problems.

* Contact dermatitis is when contact with environmental allergens can cause redness, itching, and a rash.

* Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin, often related to allergic triggers.
