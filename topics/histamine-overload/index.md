# Histamine overload

Histamine overload, also known as histamine intolerance, occurs when the body accumulates too much histamine, leading to various symptoms and health issues. Histamine is a naturally occurring compound involved in immune responses, digestion, and the central nervous system. It is released by mast cells and basophils as part of the body's defense mechanism against allergens and pathogens. However, when histamine levels become excessively high, it can cause a range of adverse effects.

Common symptoms of histamine overload include headaches, migraines, nasal congestion, fatigue, hives, digestive issues, and anxiety. These symptoms arise because histamine affects multiple systems in the body, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Individuals with histamine intolerance may experience these symptoms after consuming histamine-rich foods such as aged cheeses, smoked meats, alcohol, and certain fermented products. Additionally, some people have a deficiency in diamine oxidase (DAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine, which exacerbates the condition.

Managing histamine overload typically involves dietary adjustments to avoid high-histamine foods and addressing underlying factors that contribute to elevated histamine levels. Supplements such as DAO enzyme supplements can help reduce symptoms by enhancing histamine breakdown. Additionally, antihistamines may be prescribed to alleviate acute symptoms. It's crucial for individuals experiencing chronic symptoms to seek medical advice to properly diagnose and manage the condition. Understanding and managing histamine overload is essential for improving quality of life and reducing the impact of symptoms on daily activities.
