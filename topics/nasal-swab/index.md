# Nasal swab

A nasal swab is a medical test in which a sample is collected from the inside of the nose using a swab. This sample is then analyzed to identify microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, that may be present in the nasal passages. The sample is also known as a nasopharyngeal culture.

**Purposes:**

* **Identification of Pathogens:** Nasal swabs are often performed to identify specific pathogens that may be causing symptoms of an infection. Common pathogens include bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

* **Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing:** In cases where bacterial infection is suspected, antibiotic sensitivity testing may be performed to determine which antibiotics are effective against the identified bacteria.

* **Investigating Chronic Sinusitis:** Nasal swabs may be part of the diagnostic process for individuals with chronic sinusitis. Identifying the specific microorganisms involved can guide treatment decisions.

* **Monitoring Antibiotic Resistance:** In cases of recurrent infections or when antibiotic resistance is a concern, nasal swabs can help identify the types of bacteria present and their resistance patterns to specific antibiotics.

* **Screening for Carriers:** Some individuals may carry certain bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, in their nasal passages without exhibiting symptoms of infection. Nasal swabs can be used to screen for carriers, especially in healthcare settings.
