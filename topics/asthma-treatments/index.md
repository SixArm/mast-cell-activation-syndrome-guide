# Asthma treatments

[Asthma](../asthma/) is a chronic respiratory condition. Treatment typically involves a combination of medications.

**Quick-Relief (Rescue) Medications:**

* **Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs)**: Medications for asthma attacks relax the muscles around the airways, allowing them to open up. Example: albuterol.

* **Ipratropium Bromide**: This medication can also help relax the airways and is used in combination with SABAs for acute symptom relief.

**Long-Term Control Medications:**

* **Inhaled Corticosteroids**: These anti-inflammatory medications reduce airway inflammation. Examples: fluticasone, budesonide, beclomethasone.

* **Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABAs)**: LABAs are often prescribed in combination with inhaled [corticosteroids](../corticosteroids/) to improve lung function and provide additional symptom control. Examples: salmeterol, formoterol.

* **Leukotriene Modifiers**: These reduce inflammation and improve airflow in the airways. Example: montelukast.

* **Theophylline**: This oral medication can help open the airways and improve lung function. It's used less frequently today due to potential side effects.

**Biologics:**

* **Targeted therapies**: In severe asthma cases, biologic medications may be considered that aim to address specific inflammatory pathways. Examples: omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab.
