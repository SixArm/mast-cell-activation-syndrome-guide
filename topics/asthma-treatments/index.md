# Asthma treatments

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition, and its treatment typically involves a combination of medications, lifestyle management, and the development of an asthma action plan. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain good asthma control, which means having minimal or no symptoms and being able to engage in daily activities without limitations.

**Quick-Relief (Rescue) Medications:**

* **Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs):** Medications for asthma attacks relax the muscles around the airways, allowing them to open up. Example: albuterol.

* **Ipratropium Bromide:** This medication can also help relax the airways and is used in combination with SABAs for acute symptom relief.

**Long-Term Control Medications:**

* **Inhaled Corticosteroids:** These anti-inflammatory medications reduce airway inflammation. Examples: fluticasone, budesonide, beclomethasone.

* **Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABAs):** LABAs are often prescribed in combination with inhaled corticosteroids to improve lung function and provide additional symptom control. Examples: salmeterol, formoterol.

* **Leukotriene Modifiers:** These reduce inflammation and improve airflow in the airways. Example: montelukast.

* **Theophylline:** This oral medication can help open the airways and improve lung function. It's used less frequently today due to potential side effects.

**Biologics:**

* In severe asthma cases, biologic medications may be considered. These are targeted therapies that aim to address specific inflammatory pathways. Examples: omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab.
