# Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)

Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a relaxation technique. It involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups to induce a state of physical and mental relaxation. PMR is often used as a stress management and relaxation tool and is helpful for individuals dealing with anxiety, tension, or sleep difficulties.

**Key steps**:

* **Find a Quiet Space**: Choose a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be disturbed for the duration of the exercise.

* **Get into a Comfortable Position**: Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down on your back. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so.

* **Deep Breathing**: Start with a few deep breaths to help initiate relaxation. Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your lungs to fill with air. Exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing tension as you breathe out.

* **Progressive Muscle Tension and Relaxation**: Begin with a specific muscle group, usually starting with your toes and working your way up through different muscle groups in your body. The sequence is often as follows: toes, feet, calves, thighs, hips, buttocks, abdomen, back, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, throat, face (including jaw, forehead, and eyes).

* **Tense the Muscles**: Focus on one muscle group at a time. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, intentionally tense the muscles in that specific group for about 5-10 seconds. Make sure the tension is moderate and not causing pain.

* **Release and Relax**: Suddenly release the tension in that muscle group as you exhale. Focus on the sensation of relaxation and notice the contrast between tension and relaxation.

* **Pause Between Muscle Groups**: Take a few moments of rest between muscle groups. Breathe naturally and allow yourself to experience the relaxation before moving on to the next muscle group.

* **Repeat the Process**: Repeat the process for each muscle group in your body, working your way up or down systematically.

* **General Relaxation**: Once you've completed the entire sequence, take a few moments to enjoy the overall sense of relaxation throughout your body.

* **Practice Regularly**: To benefit from PMR, practice it regularly. You can do it daily or whenever you feel the need for relaxation and stress reduction.
