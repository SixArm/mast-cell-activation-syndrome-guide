# Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects people with ovaries, particularly during their reproductive years. PCOS is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management.

**Key points:**

* **Irregular Menstrual Cycles:** One of the hallmark features of PCOS is irregular menstrual cycles. This can manifest as infrequent periods, prolonged periods, or unpredictable menstrual cycles.

* **Hyperandrogenism:** PCOS is often associated with higher levels of androgens, which are male hormones that females also produce. This may lead to symptoms such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and male-pattern baldness.

* **Ovulatory Dysfunction:** Many individuals with PCOS may experience anovulation, where the ovaries do not release eggs regularly. This can contribute to infertility.

* **Polycystic Ovaries:** The term "polycystic" refers to the appearance of the ovaries on ultrasound. Multiple small follicles may be visible, but the term can be misleading as not all individuals with PCOS have multiple cysts.

* **Insulin Resistance:** Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin, is common in PCOS.

* **Metabolic Abnormalities:** PCOS is associated with an increased risk of metabolic issues, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels.

* **Weight Management:** Weight management is often a key component of PCOS management. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help improve symptoms and reduce the risk of metabolic complications.

* **Treatment Options:** Treatment may include hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills) to regulate menstrual cycles, anti-androgen medications to manage symptoms like hirsutism, and lifestyle changes for weight management.

* **Fertility Concerns:** For individuals with PCOS trying to conceive, fertility treatments such as ovulation induction with medications like clomiphene or assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be considered.
