# Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)

Vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) is a water-soluble B-vitamin that plays a critical role in a variety of essential bodily functions. Cobalamin is unique among the B-vitamins because it contains cobalt, a mineral that is vital for its structure and function.

**Key points:**

* **DNA Synthesis**: Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. It is required for the formation of new cells and is particularly important for the production of red blood cells.

* **Red Blood Cell Formation**: Vitamin B12  is crucial for the maturation and proper functioning of red blood cells.

* **Nervous System Health**: Vitamin B12 is essential for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system, and the formation of the myelin sheath, which insulates and protects nerve cells.

* **Energy Metabolism**: Vitamin B12 is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It helps convert food into energy, contributing to overall metabolic function.

* **Methyl Group Transfer**: Vitamin B12 is essential for the transfer of methyl groups in various biochemical reactions.

* **Deficiency**: It can lead to a range of symptoms, including anemia, fatigue, neurological problems, and potentially irreversible nerve damage if left untreated.

Dietary sources of vitamin B12 include animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is not found in plant-based foods, so vegetarians and vegans need to obtain B12 from fortified foods or supplements. The human body can store vitamin B12 in the liver for several years, so deficiency is relatively rare but can occur.
