# Hurting

"Hurting so so so deeply. And I am so so unsupported."

"Being sick so much has really made me lose faith in so many human beings as so many people struggle with their empathyâ€¦"

"I've just been traumatized and horrified recently when I've had mold illness and reoccurring pneumonia with just how crazy so many humans can be."

"My faith in humanity is completely gone. The way I've been treated. The way I've seen other sick people, elderly folks, and human beings treated. I have no words."
