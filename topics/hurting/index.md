# Hurting

"Hurting so so so deeply. And I am so so unsupported."

"Being sick so much has really made me lose faith in so many human beings as so many people struggle with their empathy…"

"I've just been traumatized and horrified recently when I've had mold illness and reoccurring pneumonia with just how crazy so many humans can be."

"My faith in humanity is completely gone. The way I've been treated. The way I've seen other sick people, elderly folks, and human beings treated. I have no words."

"I’ve been in the ER like 30 times in the past year."

"I’m so exhausted of having a totally uncontrolled illness and no idea what makes it flare. I just kept being told I have anxiety and need to go to therapy and drink more water."

"I’ve struggled with my health well over thirteen years now and I’m at my wits end."

"Worrying over reactions every meal, exposure, malnutrition, debating how to handle living... I'm not sure how to cope with the uncertainty in anxiety, stress, or symptoms."

"I was allergic to the medicine at the ER. I had my throat close, had a cardiac arrest, and died for several minutes."

"I said you don’t get how bad it is right now. 45 minutes later I was in the ER. They said 5 minutes later I would have died."

"This has been happening every night. I barely sleep my body won’t shut down. I’m stuck in this dread state and my body feels weak. I’m crawling out of my skin. I get really hot and really cold. Sometimes I have diarrhea and compulsive vomiting with it. I can’t take this anymore it’s been 5 years and I don’t know what to do."
