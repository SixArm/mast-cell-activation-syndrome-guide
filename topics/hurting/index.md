# Hurting

"Hurting so so so deeply. And I am so so unsupported."

"Being sick so much has really made me lose faith in so many human beings as so many people struggle with their empathy."

"I’ve struggled with my health for ten years now and I’m at my wits end."

"I’m so exhausted of having a totally uncontrolled illness and no idea what makes it flare. I just kept being told I have anxiety and need to go to therapy and drink more water."

"Worrying over reactions every meal, exposure, malnutrition, debating how to handle living… I'm not sure how to cope with the uncertainty in anxiety, stress, or symptoms."

"I was allergic to the medicine at the ER. I had my throat close, had a cardiac arrest, and died for several minutes."

"This has been happening every night. I barely sleep. My body won’t shut down. I’m stuck in this dread state and my body feels weak. I get really hot and really cold. I have diarrhea and vomiting. I can’t take this anymore. It’s been 5 years and I don’t know what to do."

"It's so upsetting and lonely. I dread when someone asks me how I am."

"My faith in humanity is completely gone. The way I've been treated. The way I've seen other sick people, elderly folks, and human beings treated. I have no words."

"I feel like a broken record that skips songs and sometimes randomly plays in reverse. It is nearly impossible for others to understand."

"I can barely eat any food. I can hardly get out of bed. I’ve lost everything I own, including my pets."

"The only thing that helps my flares now are handfuls of benzos which overall is not a solution."

"I am currently praying for something to take me out the pain is so bad."
