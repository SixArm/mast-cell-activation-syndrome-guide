**Syndromes**: Certain groups of symptoms that occur together can be classified as a syndrome. Once your healthcare provider identifies a syndrome, they may be able to further classify your condition as a disorder or a disease.

**Disorders**: A disorder is a group of symptoms that disrupt normal functions in the body or cause significant impairment. For example, if you are experiencing arthritis symptoms such as pain in your joints, your healthcare provider may tell you that you have arthritis. Without knowing the exact cause of your symptoms, you may simply be told you have an arthritis disorder.

**Diseases**: A disease is a medical condition that has a clear cause. For example, once the cause of your arthritis is discovered, then you will be informed of the disease. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the cause is the immune system attacking the joints.1

**Illnesses**: An illness is a broad concept and subjective. You may identify as feeling ill based on your symptoms, even without any medical diagnosis.

**Conditions**: A condition indicates your state of health. It is an abnormal state that feels different from your normal state of well-being. Often, you’ll hear about someone’s condition when they are hospitalized and noted as being in stable or critical condition.
