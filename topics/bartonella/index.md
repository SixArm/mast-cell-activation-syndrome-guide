# Bartonella

Bartonella is a genus of bacteria that includes several species capable of infecting mammals, including humans. These bacteria are typically transmitted through the bites of infected arthropods, such as fleas, ticks, and sandflies. Bartonella infections can cause a range of symptoms and are associated with various clinical conditions.

**Key points**:

* **Bartonellosis**: Bartonellosis may involve systemic symptoms, neurological manifestations, and cardiovascular complications.

* **Chronic Infections**: Bartonella infections can sometimes become chronic, leading to persistent symptoms. Chronic Bartonella infections have been implicated in conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome and various neurologic and rheumatologic symptoms.

* **Clinical Conditions**: Bartonella henselae is a common cause of cat scratch fever, transmitted by infected cats. Bartonella quintana is associated with trench fever, transmitted by body lice.

* **Diagnosis**: Serological tests and molecular diagnostics may be used for diagnosis.

* **Treatment**: Antibiotics are commonly used for the treatment of Bartonella infections.

* **Prevention**: Prevention strategies include avoiding contact with vectors, using insect repellents, and practicing good hygiene, especially for individuals in close contact with cats.
