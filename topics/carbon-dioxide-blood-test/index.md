# Carbon dioxide (CO2) blood test

The carbon dioxide (CO2) blood test measures the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, primarily in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3-). This test is often part of an electrolyte panel and helps assess the body's acid-base balance and respiratory function. CO2 levels are crucial in maintaining the body's pH, indicating how well the lungs and kidneys are managing the body's acid-base status.

Typically, the CO2 blood test is used to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting blood bicarbonate levels. Abnormal CO2 levels can point to various medical conditions. Elevated CO2 levels may indicate respiratory acidosis, which can result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypoventilation, or metabolic alkalosis due to prolonged vomiting or diuretic use. Conversely, low CO2 levels might suggest respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis from conditions like diabetic ketoacidosis, or kidney disease.

The test involves drawing a blood sample from a vein, usually from the arm. The results are usually available within a few hours to a day. It is important to interpret CO2 levels in conjunction with other electrolyte and arterial blood gas measurements for a comprehensive assessment.

Accurate measurement of CO2 levels is essential for diagnosing and managing respiratory and metabolic disorders. Understanding CO2 levels helps healthcare providers determine the underlying cause of acid-base imbalances and guide appropriate treatment strategies. Regular monitoring of CO2 levels is important for patients with chronic respiratory conditions or metabolic disorders to ensure optimal management and prevent complications.
