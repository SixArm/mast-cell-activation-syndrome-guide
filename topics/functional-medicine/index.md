# Functional medicine

Functional medicine is an approach to healthcare that focuses on understanding the root causes of illness and treating the whole person, rather than just addressing specific symptoms or diseases. It is an integrative and patient-centered approach to medicine that combines aspects of traditional Western medicine with complementary and alternative therapies. Functional medicine practitioners aim to create a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's health by considering genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and other factors that can influence well-being.

Functional medicine practitioners aim to identify and address the underlying imbalances in the body that contribute to disease or discomfort. By treating the root causes, rather than just the symptoms, they seek to improve overall health and well-being.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Holistic Approach: Functional medicine looks at the body as an integrated system, considering the interactions between various organs and systems. Practitioners consider how all aspects of a person's life, including genetics, nutrition, stress, and environment, can impact health.

Personalized Care: Treatment plans are tailored to the individual patient. The goal is to address the specific underlying causes of health issues unique to each person.

Preventive Focus: Functional medicine emphasizes preventive care and aims to identify and address potential health issues before they become more serious.

Nutrition and Lifestyle: Diet and lifestyle factors play a central role in functional medicine. Practitioners often provide guidance on nutrition, exercise, and stress management to promote overall well-being.

Use of Complementary Therapies: Functional medicine integrates a wide range of therapeutic approaches, including dietary supplements, herbal medicine, acupuncture, and other complementary and alternative therapies.

In-Depth Testing: Functional medicine practitioners often use extensive laboratory testing to assess a patient's health, including tests that may not be part of traditional medical assessments.

Patient-Centered Care: Patients are encouraged to actively participate in their healthcare decisions and treatment plans. The practitioner and patient work together as a team to address health concerns.

Chronic Disease Management: Functional medicine is often used to address chronic health conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and more.
