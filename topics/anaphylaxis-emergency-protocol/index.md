# Anaphylaxis emergency treatment

Anaphylaxis emergency treatment for a patient, or healthcare provider, in a pre-hospital setting:

1. If symptoms are severe, or worsening quickly, then use emergency adrenaline auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen) and go immediately to emergency room.

2. Avoid triggers: remove trigger or remove self from triggers.

3. Administer extra doses of H1 and H2 blockers: such as ranitident/cimetidine + fexofenadine/hydroxyzine/diphenhydramine.
  
4. Administer corticosteroids because these may prevent prolonged anaphylaxis treatment.

5. Treatment specific to primary receptors involved in reactions
  
  * H1 reactions (skin and repiratory: mucous overpdocution, asthma, throuat tightening, skin itching):

    * Stop asthma attack: albuterol sulfate, cromolyn sodium nebulized and/or inhaled

    * Stop cough: cough drops

    * Clean up mucus: guaifenesin

  * H2 reactions (GI and cardiac: sudden diarrhea, gas, bloating, vomiting, nausea, low blodd pressure, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feels like you may pass out):

    * Stop H2 reaction: activated charcoal, cholestyramine, bland food to soak up the irritant and prevent new reactions
  
    * Nausea: sea bands

    * Cardiac symptoms, including low blood pressure: electrolytes and fluids, lay down, assess severity

  * H3 reactions (neurological: confusion, motor control loss, fatigue, migraine, depression)

    * No current medical treatment.

    * Reduce likelihood of secondary injury: rest, do not drive, do not operate heavy machinery

    * Reduce triggers as much as possible: retreat to safe room or mobile ienvironmental containment unit; lay down; breathe clean, fresh, trigger-free air.
