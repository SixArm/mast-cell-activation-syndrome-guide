# Anaphylaxis emergency protocol

TODO

Anaphylaxis grades:

* Grade 1: hives, rash, itching, swelling of mouth/throat.

* Grade 2: any above plus hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, presyncope, GI distress (including but not limited to pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)

* Grade 3: any of the above, plus profound hypotension, bradycardia or tachycardia, confusion, cardiovascular collapse, bronchiospasm, hypoxia (SaO2 < 92%).

* Grade 4: cardiac arrest

Anaphylaxis treatment in a pre-hospital setting, for patient, or care-giver, or IHSS provider, for grade 1 & 2:

* Avoid triggers: remove trigger or remove self from triggers.

* Administer extra doses of H1 and H2 blockers: such as ranitident/cimetidine + fexofenadine/hydroxyzine/diphenhydramine.
  
* Administer corticosteroids because these may prevent prolonged anaphylaxis treatment.

* Treatment specific to primary receptors involved in reactions
  
  * H1 reactions (skin and repiratory: mucous overpdocution, asthma, throuat tightening, skin itching):

    * Stop asthma attack: albuterol sulfate, cromolyn sodium nebulized and/or inhaled

    * Stop cough: cough drops

    * Clean up mucus: guaifenesin

  * H2 reactions (GI and cardiac: sudden diarrhea, gas, bloating, vomiting, nausea, low blodd pressure, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feels like you may pass out):

    * Stop H2 reaction: activated charcoal, cholestyramine, bland food to soak up the irritant and prevent new reactions
  
    * Nausea: sea bands

    * Cardiac symptoms, including low blood pressure: electrolytes and fluids, lay down, assess severity

  * H3 reactions (neurological: confusion, motor control loss, fatigue, migraine, depression)

    * No current medical treatment.

    * Reduce likelihood of secondary injury: rest, do not drive, do not operate heavy machinery

    * Reduce triggers as much as possible: retreat to safe room or mobile ienvironmental containment unit; lay down; breathe clean, fresh, trigger-free air.

If not responsive to above, use emergency adrenaline auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen) and go immediately to emergency room.

Anaphylaxis treatment in a hospital setting for physicians:

* Administer adrenaline (a.k.a. epinepherine) if patient suspects anaphylaxis.

  * Administer adrenaline intramuscularly (IM) (Vasctus Lateralis muscle). Concentration is 1:10000 (1mg/1ml) solution - 0.3mg. May repeat in 15 minutes if needed.

  * Prefer preservative-free adrenaline (e.g. epinephrine).

  * Because of the risk of potentially lethal arrythmias, epinephrine should be administered IV only in profoundly hypotensive patients or patients in cardio/resperitory arrest who have failed to respond to IV volume replacement and several injected doses of epinephrine.

* Administer oxygen.

* Start large bore IV access.

* If hypotensive, then administer IV fluids.

* If wheezing is present, then consider inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators
Search instead for bronchodialotors (e.g. albuterol).
  
* Administer H1 and H2 blockers as supportive therapy. Prefer IV administration. Include diphenhydramine as an H1 blocker, given 25mg-50mg (or hydroxyzine/fexofenadine), and 1mg/kg; given very slow IV diluted in normal saline over 2-5 minutes. H2 antagonist, Ranitidine/Cimetidein, IV, should also be given.

* Administer corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) because they may prevent prolonged anaphylaxis.
