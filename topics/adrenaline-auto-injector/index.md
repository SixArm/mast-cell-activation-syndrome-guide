# Adrenaline auto-injector

An adrenaline auto-injector is a medical device designed to quickly and easily administer a dose of [adrenaline](../adrenaline/) (a.k.a. epinephrine) in cases of severe allergic reactions [anaphylaxis](../anaphylaxis/). Brand name: EpiPen.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: Emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions, such as those triggered by certain foods, insect stings, medications, or other allergens.

* **Adrenaline**: Adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) is a hormone and medication that rapidly constricts blood vessels, relaxes smooth muscles in the airways, and increases the heart rate. This counteracts anaphylaxis and can be life-saving.

* **Device Design**: The injector is a pen-like device that contains a premeasured dose of adrenaline. It is designed for ease of use by individuals in emergency situations.

* **How to Use**: Remove the safety cap. Place the needle end against the outer thigh, midway between hip and knee. Press the button to release the dose. This can be done through clothing.

* **Multiple Doses**: In some cases, more than one dose may be needed. Individuals at risk for anaphylaxis may carry more than one auto-injector, and healthcare professionals may provide guidance on when and how to use additional doses.

* **Emergency Medical Attention**: The use of an adrenaline auto-injector is an emergency measure, and individuals should seek immediate medical attention even after using the device.

* **Expiration Date**: Adrenaline auto-injectors have an expiration date, and it's crucial to check and replace them before they expire.
