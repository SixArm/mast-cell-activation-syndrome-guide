## Clayton Powers

He is a POTS physical therapist who screened me for all comorbidities of POTS. He was the one who correctly identified that I also had MCAS, hEDS, and ME/CFS first even though he couldn't diagnose it as he is only a physical therapist. His name is Dr Clayton Powers and he is at the South Jordan/Daybreak U of U clinic. I live in Davis county and I only had to see him in person once and I've seen him virtually ever since to avoid the drive. He's the most easily accessible one to get in with and he will advocate for you and find ways to get you referred to other specialists.

Getting in with him is as easy as calling his clinic and scheduling with the physical therapy office at that location and asking to schedule with him specifically.

## Richard S. Shelton

The super in-depth specialist I see at the U of U is Dr Richard S. Shelton. He is a cardiologist who specializes in POTS patients and he also screens all of his POTS patients for comorbid conditions to POTS. He's in the big U of U Hospital in SLC, in the cardiology department. He's the one who prescribes and manages my Cromolyn and over the counter stuff for MCAS. He's AMAZING. He does split his time between the U of U and the VA however so it does make it a longer wait to get in with him usually. Right now, I think he's pushed out to October but that's better than normal as it's usually a 6-8 month wait. For all I know it's pushed through November now.

## Nadia Mincilier Cobb

If you don't have a helpful PCP already, I recommend Dr Cobb at the U of U Centerville clinic. She's another one where you can see her in person once and then do virtual after that for the most part. She has been amazing because she's been EXCITED to learn about my health conditions and that's really rare for PCPs these days. She's never shied away from helping me even if some of the things I have her help me with (like getting a disability placard for my car, needing prn IV fluids at an infusion center for my POTS when I have particularly bad POTS flare, or needing a note stating my service dogs are medically necessary) are things that she doesn't encounter often, she still hears me out, listens carefully, and does everything she can to help me.

As far as I know she's still taking new patients and is fairly easy to get in with. I have no doubt she'd give you a referral to Dr Shelton if you talked to her about him and asked for one.


## Metrodora

Another place you can and should look into is the Metrodora Institute that just opened. Here's a link to them:

They specialize in our patient demographic with POTS/MCAS and other comorbid conditions. Like, the whole clinic is for patients like us. My current insurance isn't in network with them so I don't go to them because I can't afford it but I would LOVE to go see them.
