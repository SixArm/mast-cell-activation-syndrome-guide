# Meditation

Meditation is a practice that involves focusing the mind and calming the thoughts, to achieve a state of mental clarity, relaxation, and heightened awareness. It has been practiced for thousands of years in various cultures and spiritual traditions.

Meditation is a skill that develops with regular practice. Beginners may start with short sessions and gradually extend the duration. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Individuals may explore different types of meditation, such as such as guided meditation, mindfulness meditation, loving-kindness meditation, body scan meditation, movement-based meditation, and Zen meditation.
