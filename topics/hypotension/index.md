# Hypotension

Hypotension is a medical term used to describe low blood pressure, which is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries. While high blood pressure (hypertension) is a well-known health concern, low blood pressure can also have various implications for an individual's health and well-being.

Normal blood pressure typically falls within a range of 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg. Hypotension is generally defined as a blood pressure reading below 90/60 mm Hg. However, what is considered low blood pressure can vary from person to person, and some individuals may have naturally lower blood pressure without experiencing any adverse effects.

There are several potential causes and types of hypotension, including:

* Orthostatic Hypotension: This occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly when a person moves from a sitting or lying position to a standing position. Common causes include dehydration, medication side effects, and autonomic nervous system disorders.

* Neurally Mediated Hypotension (NMH): This type of hypotension is often associated with fainting (syncope) and can result from an abnormal reflex response that causes blood pressure to drop during certain activities or situations.

* Postprandial Hypotension: A drop in blood pressure after eating, which can affect some people, especially the elderly.

* Severe Infections: Serious infections can lead to septic shock, a condition characterized by dangerously low blood pressure.

* Hypotension Due to Heart Problems: Certain heart conditions, such as heart failure or bradycardia (slow heart rate), can result in low blood pressure.

* Medications: Some medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, may inadvertently cause low blood pressure as a side effect.

* Dehydration: A loss of fluids from the body can result in low blood pressure.

* Anaphylaxis: A severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure.

Symptoms of hypotension may include:

* Dizziness or lightheadedness
* Fainting (syncope)
* Fatigue
* Blurred vision
* Nausea
* Rapid or shallow breathing
* Cold, clammy skin

Treatment for hypotension depends on the underlying cause and the severity of symptoms. For mild cases, increasing fluid intake, particularly water and electrolyte-rich fluids, may be sufficient. In more severe cases or those with underlying medical conditions, healthcare professionals may recommend specific treatments, such as adjusting medications, treating the underlying condition, or using compression stockings to help improve circulation.

It's important to seek medical attention if you experience persistent or severe hypotension, especially if it is associated with symptoms like fainting or confusion, as these can be signs of a more serious underlying problem.
