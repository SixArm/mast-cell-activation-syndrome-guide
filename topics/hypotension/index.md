# Hypotension

Hypotension is a medical term used to describe low blood pressure, which is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries. While high blood pressure (hypertension) is a well-known health concern, low blood pressure can also have various implications for an individual's health and well-being.

Normal blood pressure typically falls within a range of 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg. Hypotension is generally defined as a blood pressure reading below 90/60 mm Hg.

Symptoms of hypotension may include:

* dizziness
* lightheadedness
* fainting (syncope)
* fatigue
* blurred vision
* nausea
* rapid or shallow breathing
* cold or clammy skin.

Treatment for hypotension depends on the underlying cause and the severity of symptoms. For mild cases, increasing fluid intake, particularly water and electrolyte-rich fluids, may be sufficient. In more severe cases or those with underlying medical conditions, healthcare professionals may recommend specific treatments.
