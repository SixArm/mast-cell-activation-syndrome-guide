# Low-histamine diet

A low-histamine diet is a dietary approach that restricts foods and beverages high in histamine, as well as those that can trigger the release of histamine or interfere with histamine metabolism. This type of diet is often recommended for individuals with conditions such as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), histamine intolerance, and certain allergic disorders where histamine plays a significant role in symptoms. A low-histamine diet aims to reduce the symptoms associated with an excess of histamine in the body, such as skin rashes, itching, hives, gastrointestinal issues, and more.

* **Foods to choose**: fresh meats, most fresh vegetables, some fresh fruits, some non-dairy milks, some gluten-free grains, and olive oil.

* **Foods to avoid**: fermented foods, processed meats, alcohol, certain vegetables, certain fruits, certain seafood, vinegar, canned foods, aged foods, certain beverages, and food additives.

It's important to note that individual tolerance to histamine-containing foods can vary, and some people with histamine-related conditions may be able to reintroduce certain foods over time. Keeping a food diary and working with a healthcare provider or dietitian can help you identify your specific triggers and tailor your diet accordingly.

A low-histamine diet should be followed under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it can be restrictive and may require supplementation to ensure you receive all necessary nutrients. Additionally, it's important to address any underlying health conditions and receive appropriate medical care in conjunction with dietary management.
