# Hypertension

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition characterized by elevated pressure in the arteries. It's a significant risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, as well as kidney disease.

Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as two numbers. Systolic pressure (the top number) represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and pumps blood out. Diastolic pressure (the bottom number) represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats. Normal blood pressure is typically considered to be below 120/80 mmHg. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure consistently exceeds 130/80 mmHg.

**Key points**:

* **Primary and secondary types**: Primary hypertension is the most common type of hypertension, and tends to develop gradually over many years and is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity, and stress. Secondary hypertension occurs as a result of an underlying medical condition or certain medications.

* **Risk factors**: Agee, family history, obesity, high salt intake, excessive alcohol consumption,  diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol, lack of physical activity, stress, smoking, and some chronic conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, and sleep apnea.

* **Treatment**: Lifestyle changes may include adopting a heart-healthy diet (such as the DASH diet), reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, limiting alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, and managing stress. Medications may include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, or other antihypertensive drugs.
