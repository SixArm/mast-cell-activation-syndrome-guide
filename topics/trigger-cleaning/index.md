# Trigger cleaning

Trigger cleaning refers to a set of cleaning practices and measures aimed at reducing or eliminating allergens and irritants from the environment.

**Key points**:

* **Clean Well**: Dust, vacuum, and wipe surfaces. Use hypoallergenic cleaners.

* **Remove Dust**: Use damp cloths or electrostatic dusters, to help prevent dispersion of dust into the air.

* **Vacuum**: Ideally use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to trap small particles, including allergens.

* **Wash Well**: Wash all linens, bedding, and curtains in hot water and hypoallergenic detergent to kill dust mites.

* **Protect Beds**: Consider using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers to reduce exposure to dust mites and their allergens.

* **Use Purifiers**: Use an air purifier, ideally with a HEPA filter, ideally with an activated carbon filer. If outdoor air has triggers, then keep your windows closed.

* **Pet Allergens**: Groom pets to reduce shedding. Use allergen-reducing pet shampoos. Designate pet-free zones in the home, especially in bedrooms.

* **Prevent Mold**: Address moisture issues to prevent mold growth. Use dehumidifiers in damp areas. Ensure good ventilation. Remove visible mold using cleaning solutions.

* **Ask Professionals**: Hire help for specialized cleaning, such as carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, and mold remediation.
