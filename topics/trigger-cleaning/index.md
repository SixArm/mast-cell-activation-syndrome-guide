# Trigger cleaning

Trigger cleaning refers to a set of cleaning practices and measures aimed at reducing or eliminating allergens and irritants from the environment. 

**Key points:**

* **Clean Well:** Regularly dust, vacuum, and wipe surfaces. Use hypoallergenic cleaners.

* **Remove Dust:** Use damp cloths or electrostatic dusters. Dampening the cloth helps prevent the dispersion of dust into the air.

* **Vacuum:** Ideally use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to trap small particles, including allergens.

* **Wash Linens:** Wash all linens, bedding, pillowcases, and curtains regularly in hot water and hypoallergenic detergent to kill dust mites. 
 
* **Protect Beds:** Consider using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers to reduce exposure to dust mites and their allergens.

* **Use Purifiers:** Install air purifiers with HEPA filters to capture airborne allergens. Keep windows closed when outdoor air is high in triggers.

* **Pet Allergens:** Groom pets often to reduce shedding. Use allergen-reducing pet shampoos. Designate pet-free zones in the home, especially in bedrooms.

* **Prevent Mold:** Address moisture issues promptly to prevent mold growth. Use dehumidifiers in damp areas and ensure proper ventilation. Clean and remove visible mold using appropriate cleaning solutions.

* **Ask Professionals:** Consider professional cleaning services for specialized cleaning tasks, such as deep carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, or mold remediation.

* **Choose Allergen-Resistant Materials:** Consider using allergen-resistant materials for furnishings, such as hypoallergenic pillows and mattresses.

*  **Ventilation:** Ensure proper ventilation in the home to reduce indoor air pollutants. Use exhaust fans in kitchens and bathrooms.
