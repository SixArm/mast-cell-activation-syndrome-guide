# Leukotriene inhibitors

Leukotriene inhibitors are a class of medications used to manage inflammatory conditions, particularly those involving the respiratory system. Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules produced by the immune system, by various cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, and macrophages, in response to allergens, infections, or other stimuli. Leukotriene inhibitors block the action of leukotrienes.

**Key points:**

* **Action**: Leukotriene inhibitors help reduce inflammation, relax smooth muscles in the airways, decrease mucus secretion, and improve airflow.

* **Asthma**: Leukotriene inhibitors are often used as maintenance therapy to manage asthma, particularly in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

* **Allergic Rhinitis**: Leukotriene inhibitors are also used to treat allergic rhinitis, especially when symptoms are not adequately controlled with antihistamines or intranasal corticosteroids.

* **Other Conditions**: Leukotriene inhibitors may have other potential uses in conditions such as chronic urticaria (hives), atopic dermatitis (eczema), and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects of leukotriene inhibitors may include headache, gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal pain), fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infections. Rare but serious side effects, such as neuropsychiatric events or liver toxicity, have also been reported with some medications.

**Two main types:**

* **Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)** block the action of leukotriene receptors on target cells, preventing leukotrienes from exerting their inflammatory effects. Examples: montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast.

* **Leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (LTSIs)** inhibit the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which is responsible for the synthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. Example: zileuton.
