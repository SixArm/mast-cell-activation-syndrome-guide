# Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a comprehensive and ancient system of medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years in China and other parts of East Asia.

TCM is founded on a holistic understanding of the human body, emphasizing the interconnectedness of physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It uses concepts such as Yin and Yang, the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), and the flow of Qi to diagnose and treat health issues.
