# Khellin

Khellin is a natural compound derived from the seeds of the Ammi visnaga plant, also known as Khella or Bishop's weed. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for various purposes, including the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, respiratory disorders, and kidney stones. Khellin has a derivative medication [cromolyn sodium](../cromolyn-sodium/) which is widely used for treatment of mast cell disorders.

**Key points**:

* **Vasodilator**: Khellin acts as a vasodilator, meaning it can relax and widen blood vessels. This property makes khellin potentially useful in the management of certain cardiovascular conditions, such as angina pectoris (chest pain) and hypertension (high blood pressure). By dilating blood vessels, khellin may improve blood flow to the heart and reduce the workload on the heart muscle, thereby relieving symptoms of angina and lowering blood pressure.

* **Bronchodilator**: It has bronchodilator effects, which may make it beneficial in the treatment of respiratory conditions such as asthma. By relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways, khellin may help to widen the air passages and improve breathing in individuals with asthma or other obstructive lung diseases.

* **Kidney stone protection**: It may prevent kidney stones, and may dissolve them. Khellin may help to relax the muscles of the urinary tract and increase urine flow, which could theoretically reduce the risk of stone formation or aid in the passage of kidney stones.
