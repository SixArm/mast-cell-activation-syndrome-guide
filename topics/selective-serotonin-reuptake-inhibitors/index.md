# Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of medications widely prescribed to treat depression and various anxiety disorders. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. They achieve this by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin into neurons, making more serotonin available to improve mood and reduce anxiety. Common SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro).

SSRIs are preferred in the treatment of depression and anxiety due to their relatively favorable side effect profile compared to older antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Patients taking SSRIs may experience side effects like nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain, but these are often less severe and more manageable than those associated with other antidepressant classes.

The effectiveness of SSRIs in treating depression and anxiety has been well-documented, but they are not without limitations. It can take several weeks for patients to experience the full therapeutic effects, and not all patients respond to SSRIs. Additionally, there is a risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in young adults and adolescents, necessitating close monitoring by healthcare providers during the initial treatment period.

Despite these challenges, SSRIs remain a cornerstone in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, providing significant relief for many individuals. Healthcare providers often consider SSRIs as a first-line treatment option, tailoring therapy to the individualâ€™s specific needs and monitoring for side effects to ensure the best possible outcomes.
