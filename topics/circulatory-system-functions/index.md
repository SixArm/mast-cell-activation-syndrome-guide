# Circulatory system functions

The functions of the circulatory system include:

* **Transportation**: It transports oxygen from the lungs to body tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs for elimination. It also carries nutrients from the digestive system to cells and removes metabolic waste products.

* **Immune Response**: White blood cells in the circulatory system help protect the body against infections and foreign invaders.

* **Hormone Distribution**: Hormones produced by endocrine glands are released into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body, regulating various physiological processes.

* **Temperature Regulation**: Blood helps distribute heat throughout the body, maintaining a stable core body temperature.

* **Clotting**: Platelets and clotting factors in the blood are essential for stopping bleeding when blood vessels are damaged.

* **Regulation of Blood Pressure**: The circulatory system helps regulate blood pressure, ensuring that blood flows at an appropriate pressure to reach all parts of the body.
