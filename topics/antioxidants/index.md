# Antioxidants

Antioxidants are molecules that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons. Free radicals are generated naturally during metabolic processes and can also result from external sources such as pollution, radiation, and cigarette smoke. When free radicals accumulate, they can cause oxidative stress, leading to cell damage and contributing to various chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by donating electrons, thereby preventing them from causing harm. The body produces some antioxidants endogenously, such as glutathione, but it also relies on dietary intake to maintain adequate levels. Common dietary antioxidants include vitamins C and E, selenium, and carotenoids like beta-carotene. These antioxidants are abundant in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, highlighting the importance of a balanced diet rich in plant-based foods.

The role of antioxidants in health is significant, as they help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and support overall well-being. For instance, vitamin C is essential for immune function and skin health, while vitamin E protects cell membranes from oxidative damage. Carotenoids, found in colorful fruits and vegetables, are vital for eye health and may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Selenium, a trace mineral, plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair and in protecting against oxidative stress.

While antioxidants are beneficial, it is essential to obtain them from a varied diet rather than supplements, which may not provide the same health benefits and can sometimes be harmful in excessive amounts. A diet rich in natural sources of antioxidants supports the body's ability to combat oxidative stress, promoting long-term health and disease prevention.
