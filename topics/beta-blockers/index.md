# Beta blockers

Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are a class of medications commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions. They work by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) on beta receptors in the heart and blood vessels, which helps to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and decrease the heart's workload.

Beta blockers are widely prescribed for conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), angina (chest pain), heart failure, and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). By slowing the heart rate and relaxing blood vessels, they help improve blood flow and decrease the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes.

There are several types of beta blockers, including selective and non-selective agents. Selective beta blockers, like metoprolol and atenolol, primarily affect the heart, while non-selective beta blockers, like propranolol, impact both the heart and other areas of the body, such as the lungs. This distinction is important because non-selective beta blockers can exacerbate conditions like asthma by constricting airways.

Beta blockers can also be used for non-cardiac conditions. They are effective in managing symptoms of anxiety, preventing migraines, and treating glaucoma. In anxiety, they help control physical symptoms like palpitations and tremors by reducing the body's stress response.

Beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, cold extremities, and dizziness. Additionally, they may not be appropriate for individuals with certain respiratory conditions or severe bradycardia (abnormally slow heart rate).
