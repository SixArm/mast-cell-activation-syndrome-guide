# Anaphylaxis symptoms

Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. Anaphylactic reactions involve multiple systems in the body and can have a wide range of symptoms. The symptoms of anaphylaxis can vary from person to person, but they often include a combination of the following.

Skin Symptoms:

* Hives (raised, itchy welts) on the skin

* Generalized redness and flushing of the skin

* Swelling, especially of the face, lips, tongue, and throat

Respiratory Symptoms:

* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

* Wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound while breathing)

* Coughing

* Chest tightness

* Stridor, a high-pitched, crowing sound during inhalation

Cardiovascular Symptoms:

* Rapid or weak pulse

* Low blood pressure, which can lead to dizziness or loss of consciousness

* Paleness

Gastrointestinal Symptoms:

* Nausea and vomiting

* Abdominal pain or cramping

* Diarrhea

Neurological Symptoms:

* Anxiety or a sense of impending doom

* Confusion

* Loss of consciousness

General Symptoms:

* Feeling of impending doom

* Weakness or collapse

It's important to note that anaphylaxis can progress rapidly and may involve multiple systems in the body. In some cases, the symptoms may be more subtle, especially at the beginning of an allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial to prevent severe complications or death.
