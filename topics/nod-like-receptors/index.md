# NOD-like receptors (NLRs)

NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a class of intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that play a pivotal role in the innate immune system by detecting pathogenic microorganisms and initiating inflammatory responses. NLRs are primarily found in the cytoplasm of immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, where they monitor for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

NLRs are named for their nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), a key structural feature that enables these receptors to recognize and respond to intracellular threats. There are several subfamilies of NLRs, including the NOD subfamily, the NLRP (NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing) subfamily, and the NLRC (NOD-like receptor caspase recruitment domain-containing) subfamily. Each of these subfamilies has distinct roles in immune regulation.

One of the critical functions of NLRs is the formation of inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that activate inflammatory responses. For instance, NLRP3 can form the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to various stimuli, such as microbial infections, tissue damage, or metabolic stress. This leads to the activation of caspase-1, an enzyme that processes and activates pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), promoting inflammation and immune defense.
