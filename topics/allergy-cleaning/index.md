# Allergy cleaning

"Allergy cleaning" refers to a set of cleaning practices and measures aimed at reducing or eliminating allergens from the environment, particularly those that commonly trigger allergic reactions in individuals. Allergens can include dust mites, pet dander, pollen, mold spores, and other particles that may contribute to allergy symptoms.

**Key points:**

* **Clean Well:** Establish a regular cleaning routine, including dusting, vacuuming, and cleaning surfaces.

* **Remove Dust:** Dust surfaces frequently using damp cloths or electrostatic dusters. Dampening the cloth helps prevent the dispersion of dust into the air.

* **Vacuum:** Use a vacuum cleaner equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to trap small particles, including allergens.

* **Wash Linens:** Wash all linens, bedding, pillowcases, and curtains regularly in hot water to kill dust mites. 
 
* **Protect Beds:** Consider using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers to reduce exposure to dust mites and their allergens.

* **Use Purifiers:** Install air purifiers with HEPA filters to capture airborne allergens. Air purifiers can be particularly beneficial in bedrooms and other commonly occupied spaces. Keep windows closed during high pollen seasons to prevent outdoor allergens from entering the indoor environment.

* **Pet Allergens:** If you have pets, groom them regularly to reduce shedding. Consider using allergen-reducing pet shampoos. Designate pet-free zones in the home, especially in bedrooms.

* **Prevent Mold:** Address moisture issues promptly to prevent mold growth. Use dehumidifiers in damp areas and ensure proper ventilation. Clean and remove visible mold using appropriate cleaning solutions.

* **Ask Professionals:** Consider professional cleaning services for specialized cleaning tasks, such as deep carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, or mold remediation.

* **Choose Allergen-Resistant Materials:** Consider using allergen-resistant materials for furnishings, such as hypoallergenic pillows and mattresses.

*  **Ventilation:** Ensure proper ventilation in the home to reduce indoor air pollutants. Use exhaust fans in kitchens and bathrooms.
