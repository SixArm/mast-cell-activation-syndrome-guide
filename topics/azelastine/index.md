# Azelastine

Azelastine is a antihistamine medication primarily used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, and allergic conjunctivitis. Azelastine comes as a nasal spray or eye drops. Brand name: Astelin.

**Key points**:

* **Action**: Azelastine is an antihistamine medication that works by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. Histamine is responsible for causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny or stuffy nose, and watery eyes. By blocking histamine receptors, azelastine helps alleviate these allergy symptoms.

* **Usage**: Azelastine nasal spray is typically used as a twice-daily regimen, with one spray in each nostril in the morning and evening. Azelastine eye drops are usually instilled into the affected eye(s) twice daily or as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Timing**: Azelastine provides relatively rapid relief of allergy symptoms, with noticeable improvement in nasal congestion and other symptoms within 15 to 30 minutes after administration. The duration of action can last for several hours.

* **Side Effects**: Bitter taste or nasal irritation (with nasal spray), headache, drowsiness, or eye irritation (with eye drops). These side effects are usually mild and transient. In some cases, azelastine nasal spray may cause nosebleeds or a burning sensation in the nose.

* **Precautions**: Azelastine is contraindicated in individuals with severe nasal congestion, as it may exacerbate this condition. Azelastine should be used with caution in individuals with a history of nasal septum ulceration, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma, as it may increase the risk of nasal irritation or bleeding. It should also be used with caution in individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention.
