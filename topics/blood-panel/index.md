# Blood panel

A blood panel, also known as a blood test or blood work, is a comprehensive examination of the blood's components to assess overall health and detect various medical conditions. It typically includes several tests that measure different elements within the blood, providing valuable information about the body's functioning.

One of the primary components of a blood panel is the complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. This test can help diagnose conditions like anemia, infections, and blood disorders. For example, low red blood cell counts may indicate anemia, while high white blood cell counts can suggest infection or inflammation.

Another crucial part of a blood panel is the metabolic panel, which can be either a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). The BMP includes tests for glucose, calcium, and electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, assessing kidney function and blood sugar levels. The CMP expands on this by adding tests for liver enzymes and proteins, providing a broader view of metabolic and organ health.

Lipid panels are also commonly included in blood panels, measuring cholesterol levels, including total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides. These tests are essential for evaluating cardiovascular risk and guiding lifestyle or medication interventions to improve heart health.

Blood panels can also include tests for specific markers, such as thyroid function tests (measuring TSH, T3, and T4) and hormone levels. These targeted tests help diagnose conditions like hypothyroidism or hormonal imbalances.

Regular blood panels are a valuable tool in preventive healthcare, allowing early detection and management of potential health issues. By providing a snapshot of various bodily functions, blood panels support informed medical decisions and contribute to maintaining overall health and well-being.
