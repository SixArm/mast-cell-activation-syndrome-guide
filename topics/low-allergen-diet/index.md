# Low-allergen diet

A low-allergen diet, often referred to as a hypoallergenic diet, is a dietary approach that aims to reduce or eliminate foods and ingredients that commonly trigger allergic reactions or food sensitivities. This type of diet is typically used to manage or diagnose food allergies, food intolerances, or conditions like eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome.

A low-allergen diet focuses on minimizing exposure to known allergenic or highly allergenic foods.

* **Foods to choose**: most fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats, non-dairy milk, gluten-free grains, most herbs and spices, and most cooking oils.

* **Foods to avoid**: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, casein, lactose, gluten, artificial additives and preservatives, and foods that are likely to be cross-contaminated.

A low-allergen diet can be restrictive, and it may not be suitable for everyone. If you suspect food allergies or intolerances, it's essential to work with a healthcare provider or allergist for proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can help you identify specific triggers, conduct allergy testing if needed, and develop a dietary plan tailored to your individual needs.

Additionally, dietary restrictions should be monitored to ensure you still receive essential nutrients and to address any potential nutrient deficiencies.

* **Fresh Fruits**: Most fresh fruits are safe on a low-allergen diet.

* **Fresh Vegetables**: Fresh vegetables are generally safe. Pay attention to potential cross-contamination during preparation.

* **Fresh Meats**: Fresh meats like chicken, turkey, beef, and pork are usually well-tolerated.

* **Non-Dairy Milk Alternatives**: Milk alternatives such as almond milk, coconut milk, and rice milk are often suitable for a low-allergen diet.

* **Gluten-Free Grains**: Gluten-free grains like rice, quinoa, and corn are typically included in this diet.

* **Herbs and Spices**: Most herbs and spices are considered safe, but avoid blends that may contain allergenic ingredients.

* **Oils**: Most cooking oils are typically safe on a low-allergen diet.

* **Homemade Foods**: Preparing homemade meals gives you more control over ingredient selection and reduces the risk of hidden allergens.

# Low-allergen diet: foods to avoid

* **Big allergens**: Avoid foods containing the "big allergens". These are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.

* **Highly Allergenic Ingredients**: Avoid foods containing highly allergenic ingredients like casein, lactose, gluten, and soy derivatives.

* **Processed and Prepackaged Foods**: Many processed and prepackaged foods can contain hidden allergens. It's advisable to focus on whole, unprocessed foods to minimize exposure to hidden allergens.

* **Artificial Additives**: Some food additives, such as artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, can trigger allergic reactions or intolerances in some individuals.

* **Cross-Contamination**: Be vigilant about cross-contamination, which can occur when allergenic foods come into contact with other foods or food preparation surfaces. This is especially important for people with severe allergies.
