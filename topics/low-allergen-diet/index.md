# Low-allergen diet

A low-allergen diet, often referred to as a hypoallergenic diet, is a dietary approach that aims to reduce or eliminate foods and ingredients that commonly trigger allergic reactions or food sensitivities. This type of diet is typically used to manage or diagnose food allergies, food intolerances, or conditions like eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. A low-allergen diet focuses on minimizing exposure to known allergenic or highly allergenic foods. 

* Foods to choose: most fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats, non-dairy milk, gluten-free grains, most herbs and spices, and most cooking oils.

* Foods to avoid: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, casein, lactose, gluten, artificial additives and preservatives, and foods that are likely to be cross-contaminated.

A low-allergen diet can be restrictive, and it may not be suitable for everyone. If you suspect food allergies or intolerances, it's essential to work with a healthcare provider or allergist for proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can help you identify specific triggers, conduct allergy testing if needed, and develop a dietary plan tailored to your individual needs. Additionally, dietary restrictions should be monitored to ensure you still receive essential nutrients and to address any potential nutrient deficiencies.
