# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome dietary modifications

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) treatments can use dietary modifications such as:

* Low-Histamine Diet: Some individuals with MCAS find relief by following a low-histamine diet, which involves avoiding or limiting foods that are known to trigger mast cell activation due to their high histamine content. These foods may include aged cheeses, fermented products, and certain processed or leftovers.
 
* Food Triggers: Identify and avoid specific food triggers that exacerbate your symptoms, which can vary from person to person. Keeping a food diary can be helpful for this purpose.
