# Tui Na

Tui Na (pronounced "twee nah") is a form of traditional Chinese manual therapy that dates back thousands of years. It is often used in conjunction with acupuncture, herbal medicine, and other modalities as part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Tui Na involves various hands-on techniques, including massage, manipulation, and acupressure, to stimulate the flow of qi (vital energy) within the body and promote healing. 

**Key points**:

**Principles**: Tui Na is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which views health as a state of balance and harmony between the body's internal organs, meridians (energy channels), and qi (vital energy). According to TCM theory, illness and disease arise from imbalances or blockages in the flow of qi, blood, or fluids within the body. Tui Na techniques are designed to remove obstructions, regulate qi circulation, and restore balance to the body's energetic systems.

* **Techniques**: Tui Na techniques encompass a wide range of manual manipulations, including: massage to stimulate acupoints and meridians, manipulation techniques to realign musculoskeletal structures, and passive movement techniques to loosen stiff joints, improve circulation, and reduce pain.

* **Benefits**: Tui Na is believed to have numerous health benefits, including: pain relief, improved circulation and lymphatic drainage, reduction of muscle tension and stiffness, enhanced relaxation and stress reduction, promotion of tissue healing and regeneration, regulation of body functions, emotional well-being, and mental clarity.
