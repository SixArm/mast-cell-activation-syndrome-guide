# Serum tryptase test

The serum tryptase test is a diagnostic tool used to measure the level of tryptase in the blood. Tryptase is an enzyme released by mast cells, a type of immune cell involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. This test is commonly used to assess mast cell activation.

**Overview**:

* **Purpose**: The primary purpose of the serum tryptase test is to evaluate the activity of mast cells. Mast cells release various mediators, including tryptase, during an allergic or inflammatory response.

* **Conditions for Testing**: Serum tryptase testing is often ordered when there is suspicion of mast cell disorders, such as systemic mastocytosis or Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.

* **Procedure**: A blood sample is taken from a vein, typically in the arm. The blood is collected in a tube and sent to a laboratory for analysis. The sample is usually drawn during a period of symptom exacerbation or as soon as possible after an event.

* **Interpretation**: Normal levels of tryptase are typically low, but they can temporarily increase in response to certain triggers. Persistent elevation of tryptase may suggest a chronic mast cell disorder.

* **Variations**: There are different forms of tryptase, and the test may measure total tryptase or specific isoforms. Additionally, a "baseline" tryptase level is often established for an individual, and subsequent tests are compared to this baseline.
