# Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT)

Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), commonly known as allergy shots, is a well-established method for treating allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and insect venom allergies. SCIT works by gradually desensitizing the immune system to specific allergens, thereby reducing the severity of allergic reactions over time.

The treatment involves regular injections of allergen extracts into the subcutaneous tissue, typically in the upper arm. The process begins with a buildup phase, where injections are administered one to three times a week, with gradually increasing doses. This phase usually lasts for several months. Once the maintenance dose is reached, injections are spaced out to once every two to four weeks and are continued for three to five years.

SCIT is administered in a clinical setting due to the risk of systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. This ensures that medical personnel can promptly manage any adverse effects. Despite the risk, SCIT is highly effective and can lead to long-term remission of allergy symptoms, significantly improving the quality of life for patients.

The benefits of SCIT include a substantial reduction in allergy symptoms, decreased need for medication, and potential long-term remission even after discontinuing treatment. However, its drawbacks include the need for frequent clinic visits during the buildup phase and the discomfort associated with injections.
