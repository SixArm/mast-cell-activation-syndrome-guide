# Butterbur

Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is a herbaceous plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for various health purposes. Its root and rhizome, or underground stem, are the parts of the plant most commonly used for medicinal purposes.

**Key points**:

* **Allergy Relief**: Butterbur has anti-inflammatory and antihistamine properties, and may alleviate allergy symptoms, particularly those related to hay fever and seasonal allergies.

* **Migraine Management**: Butterbur extract may be effective in preventing migraines when taken regularly.

* **Safety and Quality**: When using butterbur for health purposes, it's important to ensure that the product is from a reputable source and has had a toxic substance called pyrrolizidine alkaloids removed. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids can be harmful to the liver and are naturally present in some butterbur preparations.

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects of butterbur can include mild gastrointestinal symptoms. It is generally well-tolerated when used in recommended doses, but high doses or improper preparations may have adverse effects.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation**: Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should consult with a healthcare provider before using butterbur, as its safety during these periods has not been thoroughly studied.

* **Contraindications**: Individuals with liver disease or allergies to plants in the Asteraceae family (which butterbur belongs to) should exercise caution when considering the use of butterbur.
