# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) versus Histamine Intolerance (HI)

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI) are both conditions related to histamine dysregulation, but they have different underlying mechanisms and clinical features.

**Key points**:

* **Definition**: MCAS is primarily an immune system disorder where mast cells are hyper-activated and release excessive amounts of chemical mediators, including histamine, prostaglandins, and cytokines. HI is primarily a metabolic issue where the body has difficulty breaking down and eliminating histamine, which leads to histamine levels exceeding the body's capacity.

* **Mechanism**: In MCAS, mast cells become hyper-responsive and release their contents inappropriately, even in the absence of a real threat. In HI, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of enzymes involved in histamine metabolism, such as diamine oxidase (DAO).

* **Triggers**: MCAS triggers can include stress, infections, certain foods, medications, and environmental exposures. HI triggers are typically allergens, or medications that interfere with DAO.

* **Symptoms**: MCAS can cause many symptoms, from slow allergy-like reactions to fast anaphylactoid shock, and can be unpredictable and vary from person to person. HI symptoms often resemble an allergic reaction, and typically occur after consuming histamine-rich foods or substances that inhibit DAO.

* **Treatment**:  MCAS treatment emphasizes mast cell stabilizers and limbic system recovery, along with addressing probable causes such as toxins or infections. HI treatment emphasizes low-histamine foods and DAO supplements. Both MCAS and HI use symptom-specific medications such as antihistamines.
