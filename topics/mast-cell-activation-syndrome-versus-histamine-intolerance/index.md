# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) versus Histamine Intolerance (HI)

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI) are both conditions related to histamine dysregulation, but they have different underlying mechanisms and clinical features. 

**Key points:**

* **Definition:** MCAS is primarily an immune system disorder where mast cells, which are a type of immune cell, are activated and release excessive amounts of chemical mediators, including histamine. HI is a metabolic issue where the body has difficulty breaking down and eliminating histamine; related to histamine levels exceeding the body's capacity. 
        
* **Mechanism:** In MCAS, mast cells become hyperresponsive and release their contents inappropriately, even in the absence of a real threat. In HI, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of enzymes involved in histamine metabolism, such as diamine oxidase (DAO).

* **Symptoms:** MCAS can cause a diverse array of symptoms, and can be unpredictable and vary from person to person. HI symptoms often resemble an allergic reaction, and typically occur after consuming histamine-rich foods or substances that inhibit DAO.

* **Triggers:** MCAS triggers can include stress, infections, certain foods, medications, and environmental exposures. HI triggers are typically allergens, or medications that interfere with DAO function.

* **Treatment:** MCAS treatment involves a combination of antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and medications that target specific symptoms. HI treatment involves avoiding histamine-rich foods, minimizing triggers, and possibly taking DAO supplements.
