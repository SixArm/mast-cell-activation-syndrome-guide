# Doctor quotations

"Everyone is walking around with brain lesions & extra fluid around their heart."

"I had an argument with my previous doctor. She kept saying, well, if antihistamines help you why don’t you just take those? I told her why take antihistamines if a mast sells stabilizer does the job first? She was very resistant to the idea of a mast cell stabilizer… God knows why. Actually, I do know why, she was a pill pusher. Take a pill, and it will fix your problem. She completely ignored or didn’t know that if you keep taking antihistamines, eventually you can develop a tolerance to them. I just disregarded anything she had to say after that point."

"How do you know you have POTS? Did they even do a tilt table test on you?" Yes and full autonomic testing, an ECHO, EKG, nerve conduction test, QSART, 14 day heart monitor, stress test with pulmonary function testing, and studies of my arteries and veins in my neck, groin, legs, and abdomen.

"It’s just anxiety." - Ok well I won’t keep retuning to ER to seek help because I’m so debilitated by my body attacking itself.

"That's not a migraine. They only happen on one side of your face and if your pain was a 10 that would be like someone coming in here and chopping your leg off." - Well you tell me what my pain is then because I just begged my fiance in the car to chop my head off so I could get some relief. My brain feels swollen and if I cry or throw up it makes it feel like it's about to pop out of my eye sockets.
    
"I can't run a full thyroid panel, that would be insurance fraud."

"I'll do the colonoscopy but I think you just need more fiber."

"I've never heard of modafinil. Since you are on an antidepressant I think you should just talk to your therapist about your fatigue"

"Commit to eating better over the next month and I guarantee you you will feel better." - Sure, I've been on a medical diet for eight years and I've got POTS, dystonia in my back and neck, complex migraines with right sided facial spasms, but sure, food will fix it.

“There’s nothing wrong with you that a little Prozac wont help.”

“I hate doctors who tell their patients about disorders because they’ll just look them up and give themselves symptoms” - Talking about the Mayo Clinic specialist who said I was having MCAS symptoms and anaphylactic reactions causing my BP to drop to 69/34.

“You would be patient 0”

"Don't you want it to be asthma?? I can TREAT asthma. Why do you want it to be something I can't treat?"

"You are catastrophizing."

"Have you ever thought of drinking more water and maybe just taking a Claritin once in a while? It’s probably just seasonal allergies mixed with stress."

“MCAS is popular right now. It’s like the new thing. Everyone says they have it” my PCP said that when I told him I was suspecting this is what I have when no one could figure it out.

“Your symptoms are not of concern.” - She asked for my top 3 symptoms, and I said dysmotility/gastroparesis, neuropathy and excessive thirst to the point of not being able to sleep more than 90 min at a time overnight for 6 months.

“You’ve had a thorough workup. You need to stop seeking specialists and move on with your life.” - Rheumatologist who missed that I had Sjogrens.

“why does everyone think they have MCAS these days?” - Ooooh I was furious! Then she proceeded to talk over me and make some of the stupidest fucking suggestions I had ever heard.

"You couldn’t possibly have all these things wrong with you. You’d be dead."

"You know how neurotic you sound right now?"

"In these walls there are not enough studies to accept MCAS as a condition."

 "You're looking for a disability."

“It’s not MCAS, you don’t know what you’re talking about” - Phone call from the doc yesterday after lab results came in for my kid. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️

"So many others have it much worse than you"

Seeing how everyone gets treated, I'd just like to say, a big FUCK YOU to the bad doctors that treat MCAS patients like trash because of their own inadequacies as medical professionals. I despise pompous attitudes in the medical community; more often than not it's the type of doctor that doesn't bother reading up on the latest research concerning a patient's condition because they simply don't care enough or are arrogant enough to think their uninformed opinion is right over your lived experience.

"People can only have allergies to proteins. I don't know why your previous allergist tested you for so many things. We only test for five things in our office. It's not worth the trouble."

"It's just menopause. Should I increase your Zoloft?"

“You just need to try harder” - when I said I had systemic inflammation and no idea what it’s from.

In my 20’s a rheumatologist sent me away because I was “too young to be here.”
Another dr around the same time, “well it’s not lupus so I don’t know what you want to hear.”
One in my 30’s, 

"I can't help you. You're a mystery."

Had a hematologist told me that the rheumatologist I was going to see in the practice will laugh at me because "we dont really believe in this"

“You look ok”

“Have you tried belly breathing?”

“You sure it’s not anxiety?”

"All your blood work is perfect so you’re good to go." while nothing was accomplished with my issues).

"Take Xanax 3 times a day"

“Your labs are fine.”

“Are you sure you’re not just imagining this?”

“Maybe it’s just depression, here’s (medication name… a lot of different ones were thrown at me).”

“Maybe it’s just anxiety. Here’s (medication name).”

“One person can’t have all these symptoms.” After I showed an extensive list of symptoms. Whelp, I do… guess I’m a medical mystery.

An ER doctor told my mom this as my HR was in the 180s and BP was 145/110… I was sitting down. 

“I’m not signing papers for disability, you’re 24, you can work.”
I could go on….

"You just have bad periods" when I was literally having allergic reactions to PMS and the only resolving it was antihistamines.

For POTS: "Just don't stand up so fast." 🙄

"Cytomel is the same thing as cocaine" in response to my request for the drug when my T3 was nearly 0.

"If you're that sensitive to medications, it's probably not MCAS."

“You lose your vision when you stand up because you’re a female” - Turned out it was POTS.

“Patient seems anxious.” No shit Sherlock, I’m on Lexapro for a reason 🙄

"Lyme doesn’t exist in Kentucky so you don’t have Lyme." - Then I get a positive iGenix test.

"You look too good to be sick; I would know just by looking at you"

“You’re just stressed”

"You have body image issues"... and sent me home from hospital while my legs where 4 times their size, weighing 7kg more than 24h prior, with purple-blue skin that was visibly lacerating and I couldn't walk.

"You just want attentuon" when I had an abscess so big in my throat that I almost lost my hearing and vision and could have un-alived if I didn't present to the ER for 6 times in a row (couldn't talk nor swallow)

... or "there's nothing wrong with you" when I have since been diagnosed with over a dozen chronic degenerative conditions that "rule" my life... "if you don't take the spicy injection you'll un-unalive" when it almost un-alived me and caused me to develop a conpletely new set of conditions...

"Just donate blood you’ll feel better."

"i see you have contact with a therapist. Problems and symtoms can often SEEM to be physical even tho they are psychological" And "I don't want to treat your physical disorders, they will go away when you feel better in your soul. Until then I will prescribe epi and betapred if you ever get anaphylaxis again" *After explaining I have had apoximatly 5 anafylaxic reaction a week for the past month and am in unbearable pain from mast-related stomach issues... I "thretend" with getting a second opinion and suddenly she could prescribe Xolair, cromolyn sodium, Innovair, montelukast, antihistamins etc😅

"That’s very rare. I doubt you have that."

"You're definitely a unusual patient, I've never seen anyone have reactions to that medication."

"You have chronic mental illness because you describe issues all over the board."

When it comes to MCAS just blank stares honestly. Like M-what?
I’ve been fortunate to mostly only see docs that I knew were EDS+ friendly so I haven’t had to deal too much with doctors like that.
I did recently have an ENT ask me to do my hEDS party tricks. 🚩🚩🚩
I had an upper cervical chiropractor tell me I didn’t have CCI when I knew I did Then I got dx with it lol he’s nice though. He just didn’t understand. He was thinking cervical instability which is different.
I had a neurologist tell me he also didn’t think I had CCI before I got my dx but was absolutely willing to test for it. He still didn’t believe I had it but was extremely kind about it and never outright told me I was wrong. Just said his radiologist didn’t see it and asked if I would be willing to be tested for small fiber neuropathy (ironically I have that too haha). I gave him info on CCI and he was genuinely grateful for it and told me so. 🙂
Had a doc during my new patient exam once see my piece of paper with my “laundry list” as I said to her and laughed. Then said “I do not have time for all that but we will see what we can do!” Then set a timer right in front of me. 😒
I’ve definitely had to push like mad for everything I wanted but other than that 🤷🏻‍♀️
I’m sorry for all these docs and what they’ve said. 🙁

"You’ll make yourself sicker by thinking you’ve got more going on than you do."

"You look fine. Could you please step into this other room and fill out this psychological questionnaire? It's just something we have to do."

“Do you have anxiety in your life?” 🙂

"Are there really 15 things wrong with you?" - Yes because MCAS encompases a lot of systems in the body and Epstein Barr is a gateway for a lot of auto immune problems.

"We don't even have proof it's a real thing."

"You're above my pay grade."

"You're too sick to take as a patient."

"MCAS is the 'Designer Disease of the moment, everyone says they have it." I had never heard of it. I went to him because my asthma felt out of control. When my CKIT and HaT and some urine tests came back positive, then I reacted to his treatments, he said, "I wish we never did the tests, you were fine before them without knowing". WTF? I wasn't fine.
