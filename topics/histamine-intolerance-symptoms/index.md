# Histamine intolerance: symptoms

When the body is unable to break down histamine properly, it can lead to a range of symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms can vary among individuals, and not everyone with histamine intolerance will experience the same set of symptoms.

**Common symptoms**:

* **Headaches**: Histamine can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to headaches and migraines.

* **Flushing**: Histamine can contribute to the dilation of blood vessels, causing redness and flushing of the skin.

* **Hives (Urticaria)**: Raised, itchy welts or hives on the skin can occur as a result of histamine release.

* **Respiratory symptoms**: Sneezing, runny nose, congested nose, coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing.

* **Digestive symptoms**: Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, nausea.

* **Fatigue**: Some individuals with histamine intolerance may experience fatigue or a general feeling of tiredness.

* **Irregular Heartbeat (Arrhythmia)**: In rare cases, histamine intolerance may contribute to irregular heartbeats.

* **Anxiety and Dizziness**: Histamine can act as a neurotransmitter and may contribute to symptoms such as anxiety, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

* **Menstrual Symptoms**: Histamine intolerance may exacerbate symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, such as cramping and breast tenderness.

* **Difficulty Regulating Body Temperature**: Excessive sweating or feeling excessively hot or cold.
