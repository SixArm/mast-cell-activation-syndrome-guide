# Histamine intolerance: symptoms

Histamine intolerance is a condition characterized by an inability to break down histamine efficiently, leading to an accumulation of this compound in the body. Histamine is a naturally occurring substance involved in various physiological processes, including the immune response. When the body is unable to break down histamine properly, it can lead to a range of symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms can vary among individuals, and not everyone with histamine intolerance will experience the same set of symptoms. 

Common symptoms:

* **Headaches and Migraines**: Histamine can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to headaches and migraines in some individuals.

* **Flushing**: Histamine can contribute to the dilation of blood vessels, causing redness and flushing of the skin.

* **Hives (Urticaria)**: Raised, itchy welts or hives on the skin can occur as a result of histamine release.

Respiratory symptoms:

* Sneezing
* Runny or congested nose
* Coughing
* Shortness of breath
* Wheezing

Digestive symptoms:

Other symptoms:

* **Fatigue**: Some individuals with histamine intolerance may experience fatigue or a general feeling of tiredness.

* **Irregular Heartbeat (Arrhythmia)**: In rare cases, histamine intolerance may contribute to irregular heartbeats.

* **Anxiety and Dizziness**: Histamine can act as a neurotransmitter and may contribute to symptoms such as anxiety, dizziness, or lightheadedness.

* **Menstrual Symptoms**: Histamine intolerance may exacerbate symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, such as cramping and breast tenderness.

* **Difficulty Regulating Body Temperature**: Some individuals with histamine intolerance may have difficulty regulating body temperature, leading to symptoms such as excessive sweating or feeling excessively hot or cold.
