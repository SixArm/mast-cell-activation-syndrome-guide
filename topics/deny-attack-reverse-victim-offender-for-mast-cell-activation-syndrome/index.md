# Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim/Offender (DARVO) for mast cell activation syndrome

TODO

DARVO is an acronym used to describe a three-step psychological strategy of abusers: 1. Deny the abuse ever took place. 2. Attack the victim for attempting to hold the abuser accountable. 3. Reverse the Victim and Offender by claiming that the abuser is the real victim. DARVO turns up in organizational dynamics.

DARVO is frequently in the context of sexual abuse. However, DARVO also turns up with institutional betrayal, which refers to "wrongdoings perpetrated by an institution upon individuals dependent on that institution, including failure to prevent or respond supportively to wrongdoings by individuals committed within the context of the institution".

DARVO for mast cell activation syndrome turns up in many doctors, and DARVO looks like this:

1. Deny that mast cell activation syndrome exists, and is important to test and treat. Examples: "MCAS isn't real. MCAS is just allergies. MCAS is so rare you don't have it. MCAS can't be diagnosed without a blood/urine/allergy test. If you had MCAS you'd be much sicker. You're not sick because your test results are normal. You have allergies not an immune disorder." Solutions: take the MCAS Consensus 2 paper to the doctor; explicitly ask for test-of-treatment in writing; get a different doctor.
   
2. Attack the patient for doing their own research and advocacy. Examples: "You don't know what you're talking about. You're talking about too many symptoms. Stop asking for prescriptions. Stop asking for an immunologist. You don't need the original images. I won't refer you because you sound like a crazy person. I won't prescribe to you because you sound like you're drug-seeking." Solutions: stand your ground; get your own copies of all your medical records including all original images and data; emphasize that you're sick, you need help, and you want test-of-treatment.

3. Reverse the Victim and Offender roles. Examples: "You're asking too many questions. You think your internet search is better than my medical degree. If you know so much, why don't you write your own prescriptions? How dare you question my knowledge. You're wasting my time. You're a hypochondriac. I won't put what I say in writing because you'd try to use it against me." Solutions: show the doctor this page; alert the doctor's supervisors; write specific reviews of the doctor online to protect other patients.
