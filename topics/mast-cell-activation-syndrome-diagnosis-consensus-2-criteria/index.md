# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (mast cellAS): diagnosis consensus-2 criteria

[Source](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dx-2020-0005/html). Diagnosis established upon demonstration of the major criterion combined with at least one minor criterion (and absence of any other disease better accounting for the problems).

**Major Criterion**:

1. Constellation of clinical complaints attributable to pathologically increased mast cell activity (mast cell mediator release syndrome)

**Minor Criteria**:

1. Multifocal or disseminated infiltrates of mast cells in marrow and/or extracutaneous organ(s) (e.g., gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract; >19 mast cells/high power field)

2. Abnormal spindle-shaped morphology in >25% of mast cells in marrow or other extracutaneous organ(s)

3. Abnormal mast cell expression of CD2 and/or CD25 (i.e., co-expression of CD117/CD25 or CD117/CD2)

4. mast cell genetic changes (e.g., activating KIT codon 419, 509 or 560 mutations) shown to increase mast cell activity

5. Evidence (typically from body fluids such as whole blood, serum, plasma, or urine) of above-normal levels of mast cell mediators including: tryptase, histamine or its metabolites (e.g., N-methylhistamine), heparin, chromogranin A (note potential confounders of cardiac or renal failure, neuroendocrine tumors, recent proton pump inhibitor use, or chronic atrophic gastritis), other relatively mast cell-specific mediators (e.g., ecosanoids including prostaglandin (PG) D2, its metabolite 11-B-PGF2a, or leukotriene E4)

6. Symptomatic response to inhibitors of mast cell activation or mast cell mediator production or action.
