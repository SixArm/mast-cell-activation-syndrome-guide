# Alternative therapies

The primary treatment for MCAS involves medications like [antihistamines](../antihistamines/) and stabilizers. Some individuals also explore complementary and alternative therapies to help manage their symptoms. It's essential to discuss these options with a healthcare provider and integrate them into a comprehensive treatment plan.

**Examples:**

* **Dietary changes**: A [low-histamine diet](../low-histamine-diet/) reduces histamine-rich foods, such as aged cheeses, fermented foods, and alcohol.

* **Nutritional supplements**: [Vitamin C](../vitamin-c/) acts as a natural antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. [Quercetin](../quercetin/) is a flavonoid that can have anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing properties.

* **Probiotics**: These can support gut health and balance the microbiome. However, the choice of probiotics should be made carefully, as some contain histamine-producing strains.

* **Stress reduction**: Meditation, deep breathing, and biofeedback can help manage stress, which may exacerbate MCAS symptoms.

* **Traditional medicine**: Some people find relief via [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](../traditional-chinese-medicine/), [acupuncture](../acupuncture/), and [cupping](../cupping/), which rebalance the body's energy.

* **Herbal remedies**: [Butterbur](../butterbur/) is an herb that has been used for migraines and allergies and may have potential mast cell stabilizing effects. [Stinging nettle](../stinging-nettle/) have been used for allergies and may help reduce histamine-related symptoms.

* **Environmental Changes**: Minimize exposure to environmental allergens, pollutants, and irritants. This includes maintaining good indoor air quality.
