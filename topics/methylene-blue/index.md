# Methylene blue

Methylene blue is a blue-colored medication and dye. It has medicinal properties, and also is used in laboratories for microscopic studies.

**Key points**:

* **Methemoglobinemia Treatment**: Methylene blue is used as an antidote for methemoglobinemia, a condition where there is an abnormal increase in the amount of methemoglobin in the blood. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen effectively. Methylene blue helps convert methemoglobin back to its normal, oxygen-carrying form.

* **Urinary Tract Infections**: In some cases, methylene blue has been used as a treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has antibacterial properties and may help in reducing symptoms.

* **Antioxidant Properties**: Methylene blue has antioxidant properties, which means it can help reduce oxidative stress in cells.

* **Photodynamic Therapy**: Methylene blue is used in photodynamic therapy, a treatment that involves using light to activate a photosensitizing agent, such as methylene blue, to target and destroy abnormal cells, including cancer cells.

* **Central Nervous System Disorders**: There is ongoing research into the potential use of methylene blue in the treatment of certain central nervous system disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases.

* **Antifungal Properties**: Methylene blue has demonstrated antifungal properties, and research is ongoing to explore its potential in the treatment of fungal infections.

* **Side Effects and Precautions**: Excessive amounts can lead to side effects, including methemoglobinemia. Individuals with a deficiency of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) may be at an increased risk of hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) when exposed to methylene blue.
