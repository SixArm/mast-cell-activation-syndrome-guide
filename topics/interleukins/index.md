# Interleukins

TODO

Interleukins are a group of cytokines, which are small proteins crucial for cell signaling in the immune system. They play significant roles in regulating inflammation, immune responses, and hematopoiesis (the formation of blood cells). Initially identified as molecules that mediate communication between white blood cells, interleukins have since been found to affect a wide range of cell types and processes throughout the body.

Each interleukin has specific functions, with more than 30 different types identified so far. For example, interleukin-1 (IL-1) is involved in the inflammatory response and fever induction, while interleukin-2 (IL-2) is essential for the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells, which are critical for adaptive immunity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a dual role, acting as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory myokine, involved in immune response and metabolic regulation.

Interleukins are produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, in response to infections or other immune challenges. They help coordinate the immune response by promoting the activation and differentiation of immune cells, thus enhancing the body's ability to fight off pathogens and repair damaged tissues.

Due to their pivotal roles in immune regulation, interleukins are also involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory conditions, and cancers. This makes them targets for therapeutic interventions; for example, drugs that inhibit IL-6 are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and IL-2 therapy is used in certain cancers.
