# Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It's characterized by a range of symptoms that can significantly impact a person's daily life, including their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: Intrusive memories of the traumatic event, such as flashbacks, nightmares, or distressing thoughts. Avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, such as avoiding certain places, people, or activities. Negative changes in a person's thinking patterns and mood, such as  guilt or shame. Reactivity such as startling, irritation, or difficulties concentrating. Reckless or self-destructive behavior. Hyperarousal such as feeling on edge, or difficulty sleeping, irritability, or hypervigilance.

* **Causes**: PTSD can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as combat exposure, assault, serious accidents or injuries, natural disasters, childhood abuse or neglect, or witnessing violence.
 
* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosing PTSD typically involves a comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional. The diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms and their impact on the individual's daily functioning. The symptoms must persist for more than one month and cause significant distress or impairment.

* **Treatment**: PTSD is treatable, and several evidence-based therapies and interventions can help individuals manage their symptoms effectively: [cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)](../cognitive-behavioral-therapy/), [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)](../eye-movement-desensitization-and-reprocessing/), [antidepressant medications](../antidepressant-medications/), group therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and relaxation techniques.
