# Low-amylose diet

A low-amylose diet typically refers to a dietary approach that limits or reduces the intake of foods containing high levels of amylose, which is a type of starch. Starch is a complex carbohydrate made up of two main components: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear chain of glucose molecules linked by alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds.

**Key points:**

* **Foods High in Amylose:** Certain types of grains, legumes, and tubers. Examples of high-amylose foods include some varieties of rice, certain types of potatoes, and legumes like lentils.

* **Low-Amylose Alternatives:** Certain types of rice (e.g. jasmine rice), certain types of potatoes (e.g. white potatoes), and some foods made with refined white flour.

* **Digestibility:** The digestibility of amylose varies, and some people may find that they tolerate or digest certain types of starches better than others. Cooking methods can also affect the digestibility of starch.

* **Resistant Starch:** Resistant starch is a type of starch that resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon, where it can be fermented by gut bacteria. Resistant starch can have different effects on the body compared to readily digestible starches.

* **Potential Benefits:** The diet may have benefits related to blood sugar control, weight management, or digestive comfort.



# Low-amylose diet: foods to choose

* **White Rice:** White rice generally has lower amylose content compared to certain varieties of brown rice. Long-grain varieties like jasmine rice and basmati rice are often considered low amylose options.

* **White Potatoes:** Certain types of white potatoes, particularly those with waxy or creamy textures, tend to have lower amylose content compared to high-amylose potatoes.

* **Sweet Potatoes:** Sweet potatoes come in various varieties, and the amylose content can vary. Some sweet potato varieties may have lower amylose levels.

* **Tapioca:** Tapioca is a starchy substance extracted from the roots of the cassava plant. It is low in amylose and is often used as a thickening agent in various foods.

* **Puffed Cereals:** Some puffed cereals, such as rice cakes or puffed rice cereal, are processed to reduce amylose content.

* **Cornstarch:** Cornstarch, which is commonly used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking, is low in amylose.

* **White Bread:** White bread, especially bread made from refined white flour, tends to have lower amylose content compared to whole-grain bread.

* **Instant Noodles:** Certain types of instant noodles, especially those made from refined flours, may have lower amylose levels.


# Low-amylose diet: foods to avoid

* **Brown Rice:** Brown rice, especially long-grain varieties, tends to have higher amylose content compared to white rice.

* **Legumes:** Legumes, such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans, are rich in amylose. These foods are excellent sources of protein and fiber.

* **Whole Grains:** Whole grains, including quinoa, bulgur, and barley, can have higher amylose content compared to refined grains.

* **Oats:** Oats contain a mix of amylose and amylopectin, with the ratio varying depending on the type of oats (whole oats, steel-cut oats, rolled oats).

* **Whole Wheat Bread:** Whole wheat bread, made from whole wheat flour, can have higher amylose levels compared to white bread.

* **Bananas:** While fruits typically have lower starch content, bananas are known to contain more amylose compared to some other fruits.

* **Potatoes (Some Varieties):** Certain potato varieties, especially those with a higher starch content, may have increased levels of amylose.

* **Barley:** Barley is a whole grain that contains higher levels of amylose compared to some other grains.

* **Buckwheat:** Buckwheat, despite its name, is not a wheat but a seed. It is a gluten-free whole grain that contains amylose.

* **Whole Grain Pasta:** Pasta made from whole wheat or other whole grains may have higher amylose levels compared to pasta made from refined flours.
