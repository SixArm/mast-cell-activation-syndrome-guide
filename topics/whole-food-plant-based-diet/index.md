# Whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet

A whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet is a dietary pattern centered around whole, minimally processed plant foods. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, while minimizing or excluding animal products and processed foods. 

A WFPB diet is also more environmentally sustainable compared to diets high in animal products. Plant-based diets typically have a lower carbon footprint, require fewer natural resources (such as water and land), and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Health benefits**:

* **Reduced risk of chronic diseases**: A WFPB diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and other chronic conditions.
  
* **Weight management**: Whole plant foods are generally lower in calories and higher in fiber, which can help promote satiety and support weight loss or weight maintenance.

* **Improved gut health**: The fiber and prebiotics found in plant foods can support a healthy gut microbiome, which is associated with improved digestion and immune function.

* **Better blood sugar control**: Whole plant foods have a lower glycemic index and are less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar levels, making them beneficial for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.
