# Shop for laundry detergent

Laundry detergent recommended by mast cell people. Favor products that are hypoallergenic or that say "Free & Clear". Favor products that are free of unnecessary dyes, scents, colors, and preservatives. Generally avoid dryer sheets,  fabric softeners, chlorine bleaches, and essential oils. To get your clothes cleaner, try a long soak in hot water, then a normal wash.

If you clean your clothes well, you shouldn't need added scents and chemicals. If you want a scent, consider using a lavender dryer bag. It's just a bag filled with lavender flowers. Put the bad in the dryer with clothes. Reuse about 10 times.

#1 look into laundry stripping. Join the laundry group I linked and look at their docs for stripping among other helpful tips. Clothes will develop build up over time and that's typically what causes them to stink even after they've been washed. Also, some detergents like All are useless. I think the group has a list of the best detergents to use depending on your water hardness and if you have an HE machine.


* Lysol laundry sanitizer, fragrance free.

* Nellie's washing soda

* Sal's Suds and vinegar rinse
 
* Zum

* Clean People everything - laundry detergent, dryer sheets , dish washer pods

* Defunkify free and clear, plus the peppermint deodorizing spray as needed

* Buff City Soap is amazing and clean

I can’t get over how many people are saying to use essential oils!!! They are extremely neuro toxic!

* I use dawn dish soap with duck on bottle , can also add a drop of essential oil your not allergic to for scent

I use white vinegar for fabric softener, I love how that's working for me!

* Attitude unscented laundry detergent
 
* BioKleen laundry booster.
 
* Organic wool dryer balls.

* Persil.

* Tide free and clear

* Seventh Generation free and clear concentrate soap
 
* Oxiclean sensitive, pour some vinegar over them, and run the with the 30 soak, extra deep water, and extra rinse cycles. No fabric softener at all on mine.
