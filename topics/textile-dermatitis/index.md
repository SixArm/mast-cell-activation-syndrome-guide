# Textile dermatitis

Textile dermatitis, also known as allergic contact dermatitis from textiles, is a type of skin irritation or inflammation that occurs as a result of direct contact with certain fabrics or materials. It is a form of contact dermatitis, which is a localized skin reaction caused by exposure to an allergen or irritant.

**Key points**:

* **Chemical causes**: Textile dermatitis can be caused by substances present in fabrics, including dyes, finishing agents, flame retardants, waterproofing treatments, formaldehyde resins, and other chemicals.

* **Fiber causes**: Some individuals may experience dermatitis due to natural fibers like wool or plant-based fibers.

* **Metal causes**: Metal components in clothing, such as snaps, buttons, or zippers made of nickel, can also cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. Nickel allergy is a common cause of skin irritation.

* **Symptoms**: Common symptoms of textile dermatitis include redness, itching, rash,  swelling, or blisters, all in the areas of skin that come into contact with the fabric.

* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is typically based on a thorough medical history, including information about exposure to specific fabrics, and clinical examination. In some cases, patch testing may be done to identify the specific allergens causing the reaction.

* **Topical Treatments**: Over-the-counter or prescription topical corticosteroids and [antihistamines](../antihistamines/) may be used to alleviate symptoms of itching and inflammation associated with textile dermatitis.

* **Treatment**: The primary treatment strategy for textile dermatitis is to avoid contact with the problematic fabrics or triggers.
