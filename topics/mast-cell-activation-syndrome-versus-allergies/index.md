# Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) versus allergies

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and allergies are both immune system dysregulations, but they have different underlying aspects.

**Key points**:

* **Definition**: MCAS is primarily an immune system disorder where mast cells are hyper-activated and release excessive amounts of chemical mediators, including histamine, heparin, proteases, prostaglandins, cytokines, and growth factors. An allergy is primarily a damaging immune response by the body to a specific substance, especially a particular food, pollen, venom, dander, or dust, to which it has become hypersensitive.

* **Mechanism**: In MCAS, mast cells become hyper-responsive for as-yet unknown reasons and as-yet undetectable triggers. In an allergy, a specific allergen triggers the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which bind to mast cells to cause degranulation.

* **Triggers**: MCAS triggers can include stress, infections, foods, medications, scents, sounds, and environmental exposures. Allergy triggers are IgE mediated, by definition.

* **Symptoms**: MCAS can cause many symptoms, from slow allergy-like reactions to fast anaphylactoid shock, and can be unpredictable and vary from person to person. An allergy causes a specific allergic reaction.

* **Treatment**: MCAS treatment emphasizes mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene inhibitors, and limbic system recovery, along with addressing probable causes such as toxins or infections. Allergy treatment emphasizes allergen avoidance, medications to relieve symptoms (antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators) and immunotherapy (allergy shots or allergy drops).
