# ISAC allergy blood test

ISAC is an allergy test that covers 112 allergenic components in food and airborne allergens. It is a screening test that gives all this information during one test. ISAC is a molecular blood test, can be done from a finger prick at home, or from a vein sampletaken by a phlebotomist in a blood laboratory.

**Key points**:

* **What it covers**: The test covers airborne allergens including animals, dust mites, grass, birch, moulds as well as food allergens. The full list of allergens tested and sample export can be found online.

* **Microchip-based**: The ISAC test is a blood test that uses microchip technology to detect specific IgE antibodies to food and airborne allergens (this test uses method called ELISA with a special reader; it replaced the test previously called RAST). It allows simultaneous measurement of specific antibodies to multiple allergen components in a single test, using only a few Âµl of serum or plasma. The allergens are pre-selected and include the most relevant specie specific and cross-reactive markers.

* **No medication changes**: The test result are not affected by antihistamines or your diet at the time of doing the tests.

* **No fasting needed**: Because the test is a molecular blood test, fasting is not required.
