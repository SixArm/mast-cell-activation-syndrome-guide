# Asthma diagnosis

The diagnosis of asthma typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests.

**Key points**:

* **Medical History**: A provider will take a detailed medical history, including information about your symptoms and factors that affect your breathing difficulties.

* **Physical Examination**: A provider will assess your lung function and look for signs of asthma, such as wheezing or prolonged exhalation.

* **Rule Outs**: A provider will rule out other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or cardiac conditions that affect breathing.

Diagnostic tests:

* **Spirometry**: This test helps assess lung capacity and airflow obstruction. You will take a deep breath and then blow forcefully into a tube. This measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly you can do it.

* **Peak Flow Measurement**: This portable device measures how fast you can exhale.

* **Bronchoprovocation testing**: This test involves inhaling a substance that can trigger bronchoconstriction, which is a hallmark of asthma.

* **Positive response to medication**: If you use a bronchodilator and you improve, this suggests that you may have asthma. This is often referred to as a "reversible" or "treatable" airway obstruction.

* **Allergy testing**: Allergy skin testing or blood tests may be conducted to determine if allergens are contributing to your symptoms.
