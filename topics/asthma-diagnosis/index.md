# Asthma diagnosis

The diagnosis of asthma typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests.

Medical History: Your healthcare provider will take a detailed medical history, including information about your symptoms and factors that affect your breathing difficulties.

Physical Examination: Your healthcare provider will assess your lung function and look for signs of asthma, such as wheezing or prolonged exhalation.

Rule Out Other Conditions: Your healthcare provider will rule out other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or cardiac conditions that affect breathing.

Diagnostic Tests:

* Spirometry: You will be asked to take a deep breath and then blow forcefully into a tube connected to a spirometer. The spirometer measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly you can do it. This test helps assess lung capacity and airflow obstruction.

* Peak Flow Measurement: This portable device measures how fast you can exhale. You may be asked to use it regularly at home to monitor your lung function.

* Bronchoprovocation Testing: In some cases, if initial tests are inconclusive, your healthcare provider may perform a bronchoprovocation test. This test involves inhaling a substance that can trigger bronchoconstriction, which is a hallmark of asthma.

* Positive response to medication: If you show improvement in lung function after using a bronchodilator like albuterol, this suggests that you may have asthma. This is often referred to as a "reversible" or "treatable" airway obstruction.

* Allergy Testing: Allergy skin testing or blood tests may be conducted to determine if allergens are contributing to your symptoms.
