# Asthma diagnosis

[Asthma](../asthma/) diagnosis typically involves a combination of [medical history](../medical-history/), [physical examination](../physical-examination/), and [diagnostic tests](../diagnostic-tests/).

**Key points**:

* **Medical History**: A provider gathers information about your symptoms and factors that affect your breathing difficulties.

* **Physical Examination**: A provider assesses your lung function, and looks for signs of asthma, such as wheezing.

* **Rule Outs**: A provider rules out other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or cardiac conditions that affect breathing.

**Diagnostic tests**:

* **Spirometry**: You will take a deep breath and then blow forcefully into a tube. This measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly you can do it.

* **Peak Flow Measurement**: This portable device measures how fast you can exhale.

* **Bronchoprovocation testing**: This test involves inhaling a substance that can trigger bronchoconstriction, which is a hallmark of asthma.

* **Positive response to medication**: If you use a bronchodilator and you improve, this suggests that you may have asthma. This is often referred to as a "reversible" or "treatable" airway obstruction.

* **Allergy testing**: Allergy skin testing or blood tests may be conducted to determine if allergens are contributing to your symptoms.
