# Testosterone

TODO

Testosterone is a vital steroid hormone predominantly produced in the testes in men and in smaller amounts in the ovaries and adrenal glands in women. It plays a crucial role in the development of male reproductive tissues, including the testes and prostate, and promotes secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, deepening of the voice, and growth of body hair.

In men, testosterone is essential for sperm production and maintaining libido. It also supports overall health and well-being by influencing mood, energy levels, and cognitive functions. Testosterone levels typically peak during adolescence and early adulthood, gradually declining with age. Low testosterone levels can lead to symptoms such as reduced sex drive, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, fatigue, and depression.

In women, testosterone contributes to ovarian function, bone strength, and the maintenance of libido. Although the levels are significantly lower compared to men, testosterone still plays a critical role in overall health. An imbalance, either high or low, can cause various issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or decreased sexual desire.

Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is commonly used to treat low testosterone levels in men, often through injections, patches, gels, or implants. While TRT can alleviate symptoms of testosterone deficiency, it carries potential risks such as increased red blood cell count, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular issues, necessitating careful medical supervision.
