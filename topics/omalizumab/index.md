# Omalizumab

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody medication used for the treatment of certain allergic conditions. It is also known as brand name Xolair. Omalizumab is designed to target and inhibit the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody involved in allergic reactions.

Brand name: Xolair.

**Key points**:

* **Mechanism of Action**: Omalizumab binds to the IgE antibodies circulating in the blood. This prevents IgE from attaching to immune cells and triggering the release of substances that contribute to allergic reactions.

* **Indications**: Omalizumab is primarily used in the treatment of two conditions: allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives without a known cause).

* **Administration**: Omalizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection, usually once every two to four weeks, depending on the specific condition being treated.

* **Monitoring and Side Effects**: Regular monitoring is necessary during omalizumab treatment. Common side effects may include injection site reactions, headaches, viral infections, and upper respiratory tract infections.

* **Patient Eligibility**: Eligibility for omalizumab is determined by healthcare providers based on the severity and nature of the allergic condition.

* **Cost and Insurance Coverage**: Omalizumab can be an expensive medication, and insurance coverage may vary.
