# Gemifloxacin

Gemifloxacin (brand name: Factive) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the fluoroquinolone class, used primarily to treat respiratory tract infections such as acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and mild-to-moderate pneumonia. It is effective against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, making it versatile in combating bacterial infections.

Gemifloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. This inhibition disrupts bacterial cell division and leads to cell death, effectively clearing the infection.

Administered orally, gemifloxacin is typically prescribed in a dose of 320 mg once daily. The duration of treatment varies based on the infection being treated, generally ranging from 5 to 7 days. Its convenient once-daily dosing improves patient compliance.

While gemifloxacin is generally well-tolerated, it can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, headache, rash, and dizziness. More serious but less common side effects include tendonitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects such as seizures and hallucinations. Due to these potential risks, the use of gemifloxacin should be carefully considered, especially in patients with a history of tendon disorders or those taking corticosteroids.

The emergence of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones, including gemifloxacin, is a significant concern. To reduce this risk, it is crucial to use gemifloxacin only when prescribed and to complete the entire course of treatment as directed by a healthcare professional.
