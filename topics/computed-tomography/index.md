# Computed tomography (CT)

Computed tomography (CT) is a medical imaging technique that combines X-ray measurements taken from different angles around the body to create cross-sectional images, or slices, of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues. These detailed images are generated by a computer, which processes the X-ray data to produce a comprehensive view of the internal structures. CT scans are highly valuable for diagnosing a wide range of conditions, including injuries, infections, and cancers, and are often used in emergency situations due to their speed and accuracy.

During a CT scan, the patient lies on a table that moves through a large, doughnut-shaped scanner. The X-ray tube rotates around the patient, taking multiple images from different angles. These images are then compiled by the computer to create a series of cross-sectional views. In some cases, a contrast dye is administered orally or intravenously to enhance the visibility of specific areas, such as blood vessels or the gastrointestinal tract. The procedure is painless and typically takes just a few minutes, though the patient must remain still to ensure clear images.

CT scans offer several advantages over traditional X-rays, including the ability to visualize complex structures in greater detail and to detect small abnormalities that might be missed on standard X-rays. However, they do expose patients to higher levels of ionizing radiation, which is a consideration, especially for repeated imaging. Despite this, the benefits of CT scans in providing critical diagnostic information often outweigh the risks, making them a crucial tool in modern medicine.
