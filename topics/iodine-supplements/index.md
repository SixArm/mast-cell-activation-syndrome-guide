# Iodine supplements

Iodine supplements are dietary supplements that contain iodine. Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, growth, development, and energy balance.

**Key points**:

* **Purpose**: Provide additional iodine to individuals who may not be getting enough through their diet alone.

* **Dosage**: Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) os 150 micrograms (mcg) per day. However, individual needs may vary, and some populations, such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, may require higher doses.

* **Types of Iodine**: Iodine supplements may contain different forms of iodine, such as elemental iodine, potassium iodide, or iodine complexes. Potassium iodide is the most common form used in supplements due to its stability and bioavailability. It is easily absorbed by the body and efficiently utilized for thyroid hormone synthesis.

* **Benefits**: Iodine supplements can help prevent iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and support thyroid health. Adequate iodine intake is essential for maintaining normal thyroid function and preventing conditions such as hypothyroidism, goiter, and developmental abnormalities. Iodine supplements may also be used to treat certain thyroid conditions, such as iodine deficiency goiter or thyroid cancer.
