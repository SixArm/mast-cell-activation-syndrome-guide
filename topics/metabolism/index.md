# Metabolism

Metabolism encompasses all the chemical reactions that occur within a living organism to maintain life. These reactions can be broadly divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism means breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, which releases energy. Anabolism means building up complex molecules from simpler ones, which requires energy.

Central to metabolism is the conversion of food into energy. This process begins with digestion, where macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—are broken down into smaller molecules like glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. These molecules are then absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to cells, where they undergo further metabolic processes.

Glucose metabolism is a key component of energy production. Through glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of the cell. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria, where it is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), generating additional ATP and high-energy electron carriers. These carriers transfer electrons to the electron transport chain, culminating in the production of a significant amount of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

In addition to energy production, metabolism includes biosynthetic processes essential for cell growth, repair, and maintenance. These processes involve synthesizing nucleotides for DNA and RNA, amino acids for proteins, and lipids for cell membranes.
