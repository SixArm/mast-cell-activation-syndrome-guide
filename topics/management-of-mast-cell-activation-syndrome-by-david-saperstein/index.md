Mast cell activation syndrome is a condition where the allergic system goes haywire. This occurs in many patients with EDS, POTS, or Dysautonomias. Individuals with MCAS are prone to unpredictable rashes, hives, or skin sensitivities.

MCAS can be hard to diagnose. There are blood and urine tests, but these are frequently normal. Through the use of [antihistamines](../antihistamines/), mast cell stabilizers, and other medications, the symptoms of MCAS can often be brought under control.

Dr. David Saperstein worked with a group of mast cell activation specialists, an effort led by Dr. Lawrence Afrin to propose new diagnostic criteria to update a Diagnosis Journal that was first published on January 22, 2014. This journal is called Diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome: a Global "Consensus-2". It is a must-read for all neurologists.
