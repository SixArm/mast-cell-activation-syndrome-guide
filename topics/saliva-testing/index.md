# Saliva testing

Saliva testing is a non-invasive diagnostic method used to measure various biomarkers, including hormones, enzymes, antibodies, and drugs. This type of testing is increasingly popular due to its convenience, ease of collection, and ability to reflect real-time physiological changes.

One of the most common applications of saliva testing is hormone measurement, particularly for cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA. Unlike blood tests, saliva testing measures the free, bioavailable fraction of hormones, providing a more accurate reflection of the hormones that are actively available to the bodyâ€™s tissues.

Saliva testing is also used in the diagnosis and monitoring of stress-related conditions. Cortisol levels, for example, are commonly assessed through saliva samples collected at different times of the day to evaluate the diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion. This can help diagnose disorders like Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency and assess chronic stress impacts.

Additionally, saliva testing is employed in infectious disease diagnosis, such as detecting antibodies for viral infections like HIV or COVID-19. It is also used for drug monitoring, particularly in testing for illicit drugs and therapeutic drug management.

The collection process is simple and painless, involving spitting into a vial or using a swab to gather saliva. This ease of collection makes saliva testing particularly suitable for children, the elderly, and those with needle phobia. However, it is crucial to follow proper collection protocols to ensure accurate results.
