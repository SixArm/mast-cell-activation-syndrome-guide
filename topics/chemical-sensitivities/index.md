# Chemical sensitivities 

Chemical sensitivities refer to adverse reactions triggered by exposure to certain chemicals. Individuals with chemical sensitivities may experience symptoms ranging from mild irritation to severe allergic reactions. Chemical sensitivities can involve sensitivity to various substances, including household products, fragrances, cleaning agents, and industrial chemicals. 

**Key points:**

* **Common Triggers:** Chemical allergies can be triggered by a wide range of substances, including fragrances, preservatives, formaldehyde, dyes, cleaning agents, pesticides, latex, and industrial chemicals.

* **Symptoms:** Symptoms of chemical allergies can vary and may include skin rashes, itching, redness, hives, nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and in severe cases, anaphylaxis.
 
* **Environmental Sensitivities:** Some individuals may develop environmental sensitivities, often referred to as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), where they experience adverse reactions to a broad range of chemicals at lower exposure levels than typically tolerated by the general population.

* **Skin Allergies:** Contact dermatitis is a type of skin allergy caused by contact with allergens, including certain chemicals. Common allergens include nickel, preservatives, and fragrances in personal care products.

* **Diagnosis:** Patch testing and other allergy tests may be conducted to identify specific allergens.

* **Management:** The primary management strategy for chemical allergies involves avoiding exposure to the allergens. This may include using fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products, choosing natural cleaning agents, and minimizing exposure to known triggers.

* **Air Quality Considerations:** Individuals with chemical allergies may benefit from improving indoor air quality by using air purifiers with activated carbon filters and maintaining good ventilation. Avoiding smoking and minimizing exposure to indoor pollutants can also contribute to a healthier indoor environment.
