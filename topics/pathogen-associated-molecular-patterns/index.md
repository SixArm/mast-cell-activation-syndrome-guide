# Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are essential molecular structures that are broadly conserved among various classes of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. These structures are recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), enabling a rapid and effective immune response against infections.

PAMPs are typically vital components of pathogens, which means they are often indispensable for the pathogen's survival and cannot easily mutate to evade detection. Examples of PAMPs include bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycan, flagellin, viral RNA, and fungal cell wall components like beta-glucans. These molecules are not present in host cells, making them ideal targets for the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self.

The recognition of PAMPs by PRRs, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), triggers intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the activation of innate immune responses. This includes the production of cytokines and chemokines, which help recruit and activate various immune cells to the site of infection, as well as the initiation of inflammatory responses that help contain and eliminate the invading pathogens.
