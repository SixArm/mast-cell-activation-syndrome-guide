# Hydroxyzine

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine medication commonly used to treat itching caused by allergies, as well as to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and tension. It belongs to the class of first-generation antihistamines. Brand names: Atarax, Vistaril.

As an antihistamine, hydroxyzine works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance produced by the body during allergic reactions. By inhibiting histamine's action, hydroxyzine can reduce itching, skin rash, and other allergy symptoms.

Additionally, hydroxyzine has sedative properties, which make it useful for managing anxiety and tension. It is often prescribed to help individuals with anxiety relax or to aid in the management of anxiety-related insomnia.

Hydroxyzine is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, oral solutions, and injections. The dosage and administration of hydroxyzine depend on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.

Common side effects of hydroxyzine may include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and blurred vision. It's important to use caution when operating machinery or engaging in activities that require mental alertness while taking hydroxyzine, as it can cause sedation. As with any medication, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and to discuss any concerns or potential side effects.
