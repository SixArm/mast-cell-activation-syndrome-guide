# Histamine intolerance: severity

The severity of histamine intolerance can vary widely among individuals.

**Key factors:**

* **Enzyme Deficiency:** Histamine intolerance is often associated with a deficiency of diamine oxidase (DAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine. The degree of enzyme deficiency can vary.

* **Dietary Triggers:** Certain foods are high in histamine or can trigger the release of histamine. The severity of symptoms may be influenced by an individual's sensitivity to specific foods.

* **Histamine Load:** The cumulative amount of histamine in the body, which includes both endogenous (produced by the body) and exogenous (from external sources) histamine, can contribute to the severity of symptoms. Factors such as gut health, bacterial overgrowth, and the efficiency of histamine clearance play a role.

* **Individual Sensitivity:** People vary in their sensitivity to histamine. Some individuals may tolerate higher levels of histamine, while others may be more sensitive.

* **Underlying Health Conditions:** Certain underlying health conditions, such as gastrointestinal disorders, mast cell disorders, or other immune system dysregulations, can contribute to histamine intolerance.

* **Medication Interactions:** Some medications can interfere with histamine metabolism or increase histamine release, potentially exacerbating symptoms.

* **Stress and Environmental Factors:** Stress and environmental factors may impact immune function and increase the likelihood of symptom flare-ups.
