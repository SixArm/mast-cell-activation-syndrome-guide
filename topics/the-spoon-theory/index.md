# The Spoon Theory 

The Spoon Theory is a metaphor used to explain the limited energy and resources that people with chronic illnesses or disabilities have to manage their daily activities. It was created by Christine Miserandino in 2003 to help her friend understand what it's like to live with lupus.

In the metaphor, spoons represent units of energy. 

* Each morning, a person with a chronic illness starts with a certain number of spoons, which symbolize their energy for the day. 

* Every task or activity, from getting out of bed to cooking a meal to socializing, requires a spoon. 
  
* Once the spoons are used up, the person may not have the energy to do anything else until they "recharge" the next day.

The Spoon Theory is a powerful way for people with chronic illnesses to communicate their experiences of fatigue and limited energy to others who may not understand what they're going through. It helps foster empathy and awareness about the challenges faced by those living with chronic conditions.
