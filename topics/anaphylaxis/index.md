# Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, and anaphylactoid reactions are all body reactions that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen or trigger. Anaphylaxis is the general term used to describe a severe, potentially life-threatening reaction that affects multiple systems in the body, that can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure and airway constriction, making it difficult to breathe;
**Key points**:

* **Anaphylaxis**: This means an allergic reaction that effects multiple body systems, and can be mild, moderate, or severe. See [analphylaxis severity](../anaphylaxis-severity/)

* **Anaphylactic shock**: This means anaphylaxis that has progressed to severe i.e. life-threatening. This must be treated immediately with an adrenaline shot and emergency medical care. Rescue medications such as antihistamines will not reliably act fast enough to stop this.

* **Anaphylactoid reaction**: this has many of the same signs, symptoms, and responses, as anaphylaxis, except without an identifiable allergen. This is See [anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid](../anaphylaxis-and-anaphlactoid/).

**Common triggers**:

* **Food Allergens**: Foods like peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, and wheat are common triggers for anaphylaxis.

* **Insect Stings**: Stings from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis.

* **Medications**: Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contrast media used in medical imaging, can trigger anaphylactic reactions.

* **Latex**: Exposure to latex, often found in gloves and medical equipment, can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals.

* **Other Allergens**: Anaphylaxis can also be triggered by other allergens, such as latex, exercise-induced allergens, and allergens found in some occupational settings.

Anaphylaxis can recur, so it's crucial for individuals who have experienced it to follow up with an allergist or immunologist to identify the trigger, receive education on prevention, and develop a personalized anaphylaxis action plan. This plan may include carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and knowing how to use them.
