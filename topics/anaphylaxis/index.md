# Anaphylaxis 

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention and treatment. Anaphylaxis can affect multiple systems in the body and can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure and airway constriction, making it difficult to breathe. Without prompt treatment, anaphylaxis can be fatal.

Common triggers for anaphylaxis include:

* Food Allergens: Foods like peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, and wheat are common triggers for anaphylaxis.

* Insect Stings: Stings from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis.

* Medications: Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contrast media used in medical imaging, can trigger anaphylactic reactions.

* Latex: Exposure to latex, often found in gloves and medical equipment, can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals.

* Other Allergens: Anaphylaxis can also be triggered by other allergens, such as latex, exercise-induced allergens, and allergens found in some occupational settings.

If you or someone you are with is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, it's essential to take immediate action: Call 911 and seek emergency medical help immediately.

Once at the hospital, additional treatments may be administered to manage and monitor the reaction, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and intravenous fluids. Anaphylaxis can recur, so it's crucial for individuals who have experienced it to follow up with an allergist or immunologist to identify the trigger, receive education on prevention, and develop a personalized anaphylaxis action plan. This plan may include carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and knowing how to use them.
