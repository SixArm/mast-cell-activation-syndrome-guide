# Mast cell stabilizer supplements

Mast cell stabilizer supplements are substances that may help stabilize mast cells, which are immune cells involved in allergic reactions and inflammatory responses. Some natural compounds and dietary supplements may have mast cell stabilizing properties, or may help modulate the immune response. Effectiveness may vary by person.

**Examples**:

* **[Quercetin](../quercetin/)**: Quercetin is a flavonoid found in many fruits and vegetables. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may help stabilize mast cells and reduce histamine release.

* **[Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)](../vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid/)**: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that may help reduce inflammation and stabilize mast cells.

* **[Omega-3](../omega-3/)**: Found in fatty fish like salmon and in fish oil supplements, omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and may help modulate the immune response, potentially reducing mast cell activation.

* **[N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)](../n-acetyl-cysteine/)**: NAC is a precursor to glutathione, a potent antioxidant in the body. It may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially stabilizing mast cells.

* **[Probiotic supplements](../probiotic-supplements/)**: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that support gut health. Some research suggests that probiotics may help regulate the immune system and reduce allergic responses, possibly by modulating mast cell activity.

* **[Butterbur](../butterbur/)**: Butterbur is an herbal supplement that has been used traditionally to treat allergies and migraines. It may have anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing effects.

* **[Bromelain](../bromelain/)**: Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple that may have anti-inflammatory properties and could help modulate immune responses, potentially stabilizing mast cells.
