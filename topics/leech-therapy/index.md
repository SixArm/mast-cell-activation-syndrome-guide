# Leech therapy

Leech therapy, also known as hirudotherapy, is an ancient medical practice that involves the application of medicinal leeches (usually species such as Hirudo medicinalis) to the skin to treat various medical conditions. Leech therapy has been used for centuries and is still utilized in modern medicine for certain conditions.

The medicinal properties of leeches come from their saliva, which contains a complex mixture of enzymes, peptides, and proteins with anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory effects. When a leech bites into the skin, it releases these substances into the bloodstream, promoting blood flow and reducing inflammation.

Leech therapy is generally considered safe when performed by trained healthcare professionals in a controlled environment. However, there are potential risks, including infection at the site of the leech bite and allergic reactions to leech saliva.

**Indications**:

* **Venous congestion**: Leeches can help improve blood circulation in areas where blood flow is compromised, such as in cases of venous congestion following surgeries or traumatic injuries.

* **Reattachment surgery**: In cases where body parts have been surgically reattached (such as fingers or ears), leech therapy can help promote blood flow to the reattached tissue, aiding in the healing process.

* ***Arthritis**: The anti-inflammatory properties of leech saliva may provide relief for symptoms of arthritis when applied to affected joints.

* **Skin conditions**: Leech therapy has also been used to treat certain skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema, although the evidence supporting its effectiveness for these conditions is limited.
