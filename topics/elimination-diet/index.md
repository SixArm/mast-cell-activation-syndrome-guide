# Elimination diet

An elimination diet is a dietary approach used to identify and eliminate specific foods or food groups that may be causing adverse reactions or symptoms in an individual. It is often employed to pinpoint and manage food allergies, food sensitivities, or other adverse reactions to certain foods.

An elimination diet should be carried out under the guidance of a healthcare professional or registered dietitian, as it can be challenging to implement effectively. They can help create a tailored plan, monitor progress, and ensure that the diet remains balanced and nutritious. Additionally, healthcare providers may recommend allergy testing or other diagnostic tests to assist in the process.

**The three phases**:

* **Elimination Phase**: During this phase, the individual removes specific foods or food groups from their diet that are suspected of causing adverse reactions. These foods are chosen based on the person's medical history, symptoms, and, in some cases, allergy testing. The elimination phase typically lasts 2 to 4 weeks.

* **Reintroduction (Challenge) Phase**: After the elimination phase, one at a time, the eliminated foods are gradually reintroduced into the diet. This is done to assess whether the person experiences any adverse reactions when these foods are consumed. Each reintroduced food is usually consumed over a period of a few days while closely monitoring for symptoms.

* **Maintenance Phase**: In this phase, the individual customizes their long-term diet based on the results of the elimination and reintroduction phases. Foods that did not cause adverse reactions are incorporated into the regular diet, while foods that trigger symptoms are permanently avoided.
