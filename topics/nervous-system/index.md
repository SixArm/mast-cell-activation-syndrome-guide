# Nervous system

The nervous system is a complex network of cells and tissues that coordinates the body's activities by transmitting signals to and from different parts of the body. It is divided into two main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The brain is the control center, processing and interpreting sensory information and coordinating voluntary and involuntary actions. The spinal cord acts as a communication highway between the brain and the rest of the body, transmitting neural signals that control movement and convey sensory information.

The PNS connects the CNS to the limbs and organs. It is divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary muscle movements and transmits sensory information to the CNS, and the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, which work in opposition to maintain homeostasis.

Neurons, the primary cells of the nervous system, transmit signals through electrical impulses and chemical neurotransmitters. These signals enable rapid communication within the body, facilitating complex processes such as thought, memory, and sensation.

The nervous system's health is vital for overall well-being. Disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathy can significantly impact its function, leading to a range of symptoms from motor impairment to cognitive decline. Maintaining a healthy nervous system involves regular physical activity, a balanced diet, mental stimulation, and avoiding harmful substances.
