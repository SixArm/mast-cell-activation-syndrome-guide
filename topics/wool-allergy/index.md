# Wool allergy

A wool allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in the fibers of wool. Wool is derived from the fleece of sheep and is commonly used in clothing, blankets, and other textiles. While wool is a natural and breathable material, some individuals may develop an allergic reaction to it.

**Key points**:

* **Allergen in Wool**: The allergenic component in wool is a protein called lanolin. Lanolin is a natural oil present in sheep's wool.

* **Symptoms**: May include redness, itching, rash, and hives. In more severe cases, individuals may experience respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing or difficulty breathing, especially if exposed to airborne wool particles.

* **Contact Dermatitis**: The most common reaction to wool is contact dermatitis, which is an inflammatory skin condition. It occurs when the skin comes into direct contact with wool fibers or fabrics containing lanolin.

* **Airborne Allergens**: In some cases, individuals may experience respiratory symptoms due to exposure to airborne wool particles. This can happen when handling or working with wool, such as during shearing or processing.

* **Cross-Reactivity**: Individuals with a wool allergy may also experience cross-reactivity with other animal fibers, such as angora or cashmere. This is because these fibers contain similar proteins.

* **Diagnosis**: A healthcare professional can diagnose a wool allergy through a combination of medical history, skin patch testing, and allergen-specific IgE blood tests. Patch testing involves applying small amounts of allergens to the skin to observe for reactions.

* **Management**: The primary management strategy for a wool allergy is to avoid contact with wool and wool-containing products. 

* **Treatment of Symptoms**: Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines and topical corticosteroids may be used to manage symptoms of contact dermatitis.

* **Prevention**: To prevent allergic reactions, individuals with a known wool allergy should read clothing labels carefully, choose hypoallergenic fabrics, and avoid direct contact with wool.
