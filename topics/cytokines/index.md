# Cytokines

Cytokines are a broad category of small proteins that are vital for cell signaling in the immune system. They play a crucial role in regulating the body's immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis (the formation of blood cells). Produced by a variety of cells, including immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes, cytokines act as messengers that enable cells to communicate and coordinate their actions in response to infections, injuries, and other challenges.

Cytokines include various subtypes, such as:

* [Interleukins](../interleukins/) are involved in stimulating immune cell growth and differentiation.
  
* [Interferons](../interferons/) have antiviral properties and help modulate the immune response.
  
* [Tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)](../tumor-necrosis-factors/) mediators of inflammation and can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) 

* [Growth factors](../growth-factors/)

The action of cytokines is complex and can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory, depending on the context and the specific cytokines involved. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1), promote inflammation and are essential in the body's defense against infections. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), help regulate and limit the inflammatory response to prevent excessive damage to tissues.

Due to their central role in immune regulation, cytokines are implicated in numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory conditions, and cancers. Therapeutic interventions targeting cytokines have been developed to treat various conditions; for example, TNF inhibitors are used to manage rheumatoid arthritis, and interleukin-2 is used in cancer therapy.
