# Sick building syndrome

"Sick building syndrome" refers to a condition in which occupants of a building experience a range of non-specific health symptoms or discomfort that are linked to the time spent in that particular building. These symptoms often improve or disappear when individuals leave the building.

**Common aspects**:

* **Non-Specific Symptoms**: People with sick building syndrome may experience a variety of symptoms that are general and non-specific. These can include headaches, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, eye, nose, or throat irritation, and difficulty concentrating.

* **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)**: Poor indoor air quality is a common factor associated with sick building syndrome. This can result from inadequate ventilation, contaminants from building materials, cleaning products, or the presence of biological pollutants such as mold.

* **Chemical and Biological Pollutants**: Building materials, furnishings, cleaning products, and other indoor sources can release chemical pollutants. Additionally, biological contaminants like mold and bacteria can thrive in damp or poorly ventilated areas.

* **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis is based on the presence of symptoms that improve when individuals leave the building. It may involve investigations into indoor air quality and potential sources of pollutants.

* **Management**: May involve improving ventilation, identifying and removing sources of pollutants, and addressing issues like moisture and mold.

* **Prevention**: Prevention measures include regular maintenance of ventilation systems, proper building design and construction, and prompt addressing of water damage or leaks to prevent mold growth.
