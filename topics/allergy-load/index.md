# Allergy load

The term "allergy load" (a.k.a. "total allergen load") refers to the cumulative
exposure to allergens that an individual experiences in their environment. When
the allergy load exceeds a person's capacity (a.k.a. "total allergen
threshold"), the the person can have allergic reactions, exacerbation of
allergic symptoms, or even development of new allergies.

Managing allergy load involves identifying and minimizing exposure to
allergens through various strategies, including allergen avoidance,
environmental control measures, dietary modifications, and allergen
immunotherapy.

**Key factors**:

* **Environmental Exposures**: Examples: pollen, mold, mites, dander, perfume, volatile organic compounds.

* **Dietary Exposures**: Examples: dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, shellfish.
  Cross-reactivity between allergens may occur, further increasing the total
  allergen load.

* **Contact Exposures**: Examples: cleaners, detergents, makeup, lotions.

* **Occupational Exposures**: Examples: chemicals, dust, fumes, latex, pesticide.

* **Capacity Factors**: Genetic predisposition, immune system function, and
  individual susceptibility to allergens can influence an individual's allergy
  load capacity and their likelihood of developing allergic diseases
