# Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine is a medication primarily used to lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol, particularly those at risk of heart disease. Brand name: Questran.

Cholestyramine belongs to the class of drugs known as [bile acid sequestrants](../bile-acid-sequestrants/), similar to [colesevelam](../colesevelam/) and [colestipol](../colestipol/). Like other bile acid sequestrants, cholestyramine works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, preventing them from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. This leads to increased excretion of bile acids in the feces, which prompts the liver to use more cholesterol to produce bile acids, thus lowering blood cholesterol levels.

In addition to lowering cholesterol, cholestyramine is also sometimes used off-label to treat other conditions, such as diarrhea associated with bile acid malabsorption and itching caused by liver disease.

It's usually taken orally as a powder or granules mixed with water or another liquid. Side effects can include constipation, bloating, gas, and stomach discomfort. As with any medication, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and discuss any concerns or potential side effects.
