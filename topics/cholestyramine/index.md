# Cholestyramine

Cholestyramine is a medication classified as a bile acid sequestrant. It is used to lower elevated levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the blood. Cholestyramine works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, which reduces their reabsorption and promotes the elimination of bile acids and cholesterol from the body. This, in turn, leads to a reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol levels.

It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan.

### Uses

Cholestyramine is primarily prescribed to individuals with high cholesterol, specifically high LDL cholesterol levels.

It is used as an adjunct to a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle changes to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### How It Works

Cholestyramine is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead, it acts within the gastrointestinal tract.

It binds to bile acids, which are needed for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.

The body compensates for the loss of bile acids by converting more cholesterol into new bile acids. This process leads to a reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol levels.

### Administration

Cholestyramine is available as a powder and should be mixed with water or another liquid before ingestion. It is taken orally.

The dose and frequency are determined by a healthcare provider based on the individual's cholesterol levels and response to treatment.

It is typically taken with meals to maximize its cholesterol-lowering effects.

### Effectiveness

Cholestyramine can significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels when used as directed. It may also have a modest impact on reducing triglyceride levels.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include constipation, bloating, gas, and stomach discomfort.

Cholestyramine may interfere with the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), so monitoring and supplementation of these vitamins may be necessary.

It is important to drink plenty of fluids while taking cholestyramine to help prevent constipation.

### Interactions

Cholestyramine can interact with other medications, potentially reducing their absorption. To prevent interactions, it is recommended to take other medications at least one hour before or four to six hours after taking cholestyramine.

### Contraindications

Cholestyramine should not be used in individuals with a history of bowel obstructions or certain gastrointestinal disorders.

### Duration of Use

Cholestyramine is generally used as a long-term treatment, but the duration of use is determined by the healthcare provider based on individual needs and response to treatment.

### Monitoring

Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to monitor cholesterol levels and assess the effectiveness of treatment.
