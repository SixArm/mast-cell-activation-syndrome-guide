# Long-term disability (LTD) insurance

Long-term disability (LTD) insurance is a crucial safety net designed to provide income replacement to individuals who are unable to work due to a severe, prolonged illness or injury. This insurance kicks in after short-term disability (STD) insurance, which covers temporary disabilities typically lasting up to six months. LTD insurance can provide coverage for several years, up to a specified age, or even for a lifetime, depending on the policy.

These policies typically replaces a percentage of the policyholder's pre-disability earnings, often ranging from 50% to 70%. This financial support helps cover essential living expenses, medical costs, and other daily necessities when the policyholder can no longer earn a regular income. The specifics of the benefit period, waiting period (the time between the onset of disability and the start of benefits), and the definition of disability can vary significantly between policies.

Eligibility for benefits generally requires comprehensive medical documentation and proof that the individual’s condition meets the policy’s definition of disability. This often involves assessments by healthcare providers and may include periodic reviews to confirm the ongoing nature of the disability.

Employers often offer LTD insurance as part of their employee benefits package, but individuals can also purchase it independently. Having LTD insurance is a proactive measure to safeguard financial stability in the event of a disabling condition, providing peace of mind and essential support during challenging times.
