# Reslizumab

TODO

Reslizumab, brand name Cinqair, is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. This biologic medication targets interleukin-5 (IL-5), a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the growth, differentiation, recruitment, and activation of eosinophils. By binding to IL-5, reslizumab inhibits its interaction with its receptor on eosinophils, thereby reducing the number of these inflammatory cells in the blood and tissues.

Administered via intravenous infusion, reslizumab is typically given once every four weeks. It is specifically indicated for patients with severe asthma who have high levels of eosinophils and whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by standard asthma therapies, such as inhaled corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated that reslizumab significantly reduces asthma exacerbations, improves lung function, and enhances the overall quality of life for patients.

The administration of reslizumab requires a healthcare setting due to the potential for infusion-related reactions, which can include symptoms like muscle pain, fatigue, and anaphylaxis in rare cases. Patients are monitored during and after the infusion to ensure any adverse effects are promptly managed.

Reslizumab's targeted approach addresses a key underlying mechanism in eosinophilic asthma, offering a significant therapeutic option for patients with this challenging condition. By reducing eosinophil levels, reslizumab helps to control severe asthma symptoms and decrease the frequency of asthma attacks, providing relief for patients who have limited options with conventional treatments.
