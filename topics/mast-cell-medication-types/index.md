# Mast cell medication types

TODO

**Mast cell stabilizers** typically means medications (or supplements, or teas, etc.) that a person can use to help protect their mast cells from degranulating i.e. from releasing their many chemicals including histamine, cortisol, etc. A typical example of a mast cell stabilizer medication is sodium cromolyn (brand name Gastrocrom).

**Antihistamines** typically means medications (etc.) that a person can take to block the action of histamine that is released. A typical example of an antihistamine is loratadine (brand name Claritin).

**IgE biologics** typically means medications (etc.) that block immunoglobulin type E from binding to allergens and inflammatory cells. A typical example of an IgE biologic is [omalizumab] (brand name Xolair).

Mast cell activation syndrome can be helped by all of the above. Each person reacts individually, so it's important for each person to talk with their healthcare providers to find what's best for them.
Some medications that can be especially good to ask about are azelastine and cetirizine, because they are double purpose: they are antihistamines and also mast cell stabilizers. If a person responds especially well to these double-purpose medications, and does not respond to various single-purpose antihistamines such as loratadine, then the doctor can use that information to diagnose MCAS.
