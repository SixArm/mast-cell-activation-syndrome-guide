# Free triiodothyronine (FT3) test

The Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) test measures the level of free triiodothyronine in the blood, an active thyroid hormone. FT3 represents the portion of triiodothyronine not bound to proteins, making it available to affect bodily tissues. T3, along with thyroxine (T4), is produced by the thyroid gland and is crucial for regulating metabolism, heart function, digestion, and brain development.

The FT3 test is often utilized to assess thyroid function and diagnose thyroid disorders, particularly when hyperthyroidism is suspected. Elevated levels of FT3 may indicate hyperthyroidism, where the thyroid gland is overactive, producing excessive thyroid hormones. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, increased heart rate, and anxiety. In some cases, FT3 can be elevated even if FT4 levels are normal, a condition known as T3 toxicosis.

This test is usually performed alongside other thyroid function tests, such as the Free Thyroxine (FT4) and Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) tests, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid health. It involves a simple blood draw, and results are typically available within a few days. Interpretation of FT3 levels should consider TSH and FT4 levels, as well as the patient's clinical symptoms.

Accurate measurement of FT3 is important for diagnosing and managing thyroid disorders. It helps guide treatment decisions, including the use of antithyroid medications or thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Regular monitoring of FT3 levels is essential in patients with thyroid conditions to ensure effective management and optimal health outcomes.
