# Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)

A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) is an expanded version of the [Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)](../basic-metabolic-panel/) that provides a broader assessment of an individual's metabolic state and organ function. The CMP includes 14 specific tests for liver and kidney function, electrolyte and fluid balance, and metabolic state. It is widely used in clinical practice to monitor patients with chronic conditions, evaluate organ function, and diagnose a variety of diseases.

The CMP consists of the eight tests found in the BMP—glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide (bicarbonate), chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine—plus six additional tests: albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin.

1. **Albumin**: A major protein made by the liver, albumin levels can indicate liver function and nutritional status.

2. **Total Protein**: Measures the total amount of albumin and globulin in the blood, reflecting overall health and nutritional status.

3. **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)**: An enzyme found in the liver and bones, elevated levels can indicate liver disease or bone disorders.

4. **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)**: An enzyme primarily found in the liver, high levels can indicate liver damage or inflammation.

5. **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)**: Another enzyme found in the liver and heart, elevated levels can also suggest liver damage or disease.

6. **Bilirubin**: A waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells, high levels can indicate liver dysfunction or hemolytic anemia.
