# Lecithin

Lecithin is a naturally occurring fatty substance found in plant and animal tissues. Lecithin is commonly extracted from sources such as soybeans, sunflower seeds, and egg yolks.

**Benefits**:

* **Cholesterol metabolism**: Lecithin contains phosphatidylcholine, which may help support healthy cholesterol levels by promoting the transport of cholesterol and other fats in the bloodstream. Lecithin supplementation may help lower LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels.

* **Liver health**: Lecithin has been studied for its potential to support liver health and function, particularly in the management of liver conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver damage caused by alcohol consumption or toxins.

* **Brain health**: Phosphatidylcholine, a component of lecithin, is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is involved in various cognitive functions, including memory and learning. Lecithin supplementation may help support cognitive function and memory.

* **Digestive health**: Lecithin may help support digestive health by promoting the emulsification of fats and aiding in their digestion and absorption. It may also help prevent gallstones by promoting the solubility of cholesterol in bile.

* **Skin health**: Lecithin supplementation may help improve skin hydration, elasticity, and barrier function.
