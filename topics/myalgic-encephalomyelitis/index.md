# Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is a complex and debilitating medical condition characterized by profound fatigue. ME/CFS affects multiple body systems, including the immune, neurological, and endocrine systems. ME/CFS can significantly impair a person's ability to carry out daily activities.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: Unexplained fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not improved by rest. Others: post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, muscle and joint pain, headaches, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, orthostatic intolerance, palpitations, and temperature dysregulation.

* **Diagnosis**: There are no specific tests. Diagnosis is primarily based on symptoms. Other potential medical and psychiatric conditions that could explain the symptoms must be ruled out.

* **Causes**: The cause is not understood and is likely multifactorial. Possible contributing factors may include viral infections, immune dysfunction, genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances, and environmental triggers. It is believed that ME/CFS may result from a combination of these factors in susceptible individuals.

* **Treatment**: Rest and pacing: Balancing activity and rest to avoid overexertion and exacerbation of symptoms. Symptom-specific treatments such as pain management, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), medications for sleep disturbances or mood disorders, dietary modifications, stress management techniques, and support groups. There is currently no cure.
