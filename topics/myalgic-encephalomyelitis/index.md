# Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)

Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is a complex and debilitating medical condition characterized by profound fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and is accompanied by a range of other symptoms. ME/CFS affects multiple body systems, including the immune, neurological, and endocrine systems, and can significantly impair a person's ability to carry out daily activities.

**Key points**:

* **Symptoms**: The primary symptom of ME/CFS is persistent and unexplained fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not improved by rest. Other common symptoms may include: post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, muscle and joint pain, headaches, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, orthostatic intolerance, palpitations, and temperature dysregulation.

* **Diagnosis**: There are no specific laboratory tests or imaging studies to diagnose ME/CFS, and diagnosis is primarily based on clinical criteria. The diagnostic criteria include the presence of unexplained fatigue lasting for at least six months, along with specific accompanying symptoms. Other potential medical and psychiatric conditions that could explain the symptoms must be ruled out.

* **Causes**: The exact cause of ME/CFS is not fully understood and is likely multifactorial. Possible contributing factors may include viral infections, immune dysfunction, genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances, and environmental triggers. It is believed that ME/CFS may result from a combination of these factors in susceptible individuals.

* **Treatment**: There is currently no cure. Rest and pacing: Balancing activity and rest to avoid overexertion and exacerbation of symptoms. Symptom-specific treatments such as pain management, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), medications for sleep disturbances or mood disorders, dietary modifications, stress management techniques, and support groups.

* **Research and Advocacy**: ME/CFS is an area of active research, and efforts are ongoing to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the condition, improve diagnostic criteria, and develop more effective treatments.
