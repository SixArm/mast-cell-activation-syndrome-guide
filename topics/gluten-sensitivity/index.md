# Gluten sensitivity

Gluten sensitivity, also known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), is a condition where individuals experience adverse symptoms when consuming gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Unlike celiac disease, which involves an autoimmune response that damages the small intestine, gluten sensitivity does not cause such damage but can still lead to significant discomfort and health issues.

Symptoms of gluten sensitivity are diverse and can include gastrointestinal issues such as bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Many individuals also report non-digestive symptoms like headaches, fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes. Cognitive effects, often referred to as "brain fog," are also common, affecting concentration and mental clarity. These symptoms typically improve when gluten is removed from the diet and return upon reintroduction.

Diagnosing gluten sensitivity can be challenging, as there are no specific tests for NCGS. The diagnosis is typically made by first ruling out celiac disease and wheat allergy through blood tests and, if necessary, a biopsy of the small intestine. If these conditions are excluded, a trial elimination of gluten from the diet is recommended, followed by a controlled reintroduction to observe symptom changes. Improvement during the gluten-free period and a recurrence of symptoms upon reintroduction strongly suggest gluten sensitivity.

Managing gluten sensitivity involves adhering to a strict gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods and products containing wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Many naturally gluten-free foods, such as fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy, are safe to consume. Additionally, numerous gluten-free alternatives for bread, pasta, and other common gluten-containing foods are available. It is essential to read labels carefully and be aware of cross-contamination in food preparation areas.

Working with a healthcare provider or a dietitian can help ensure that the gluten-free diet is balanced and nutritionally adequate. By avoiding gluten, individuals with gluten sensitivity can significantly reduce or eliminate symptoms, leading to improved health and quality of life.
