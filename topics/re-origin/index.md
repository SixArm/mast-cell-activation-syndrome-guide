# Re-Origin™

[Re-origin website](https://www.re-origin.com/) excerpts…

The re-origin program is a science-based, self-directed neuroplasticity training program with a supportive community & coaching designed for people suffering from anxiety, depression, long COVID, Lyme Disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and many other conditions.

Neuroplasticity is the foundation of our brain retraining program at re-origin. This concept refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to new experiences and stimuli, allowing us to gradually shift the inflammatory processes that underpin a wide range of chronic conditions.

In the program, you work through 6 modules of virtual classes and practice 30 minutes per day of re-training exercises.You can join weekly group calls, group coaching, and virtual events to encourage you and keep you on track.

The course, coaching, and community support you to rewire your brain and feel like yourself again, all with scientifically-backed and proven methods that you can rely on to shift persistent symptoms.
