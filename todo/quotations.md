"I had an argument with my previous doctor. She kept saying, well, if antihistamines help you why don’t you just take those? I told her why take antihistamines if a mast cell stabilizer does the job first? She was very resistant to the idea of a mast cell stabilizer… God knows why. Actually, I do know why, she was a pill pusher. Take a pill, and it will fix your problem. She completely ignored or didn’t know that if you keep taking antihistamines, eventually you can develop a tolerance to them. I just disregarded anything she had to say after that point."

"How do you know you have POTS? Did they even do a tilt table test on you?" - Yes and full autonomic testing, an ECHO, EKG, nerve conduction test, QSART, 14 day heart monitor, stress test with pulmonary function testing, and studies of my arteries and veins in my neck, groin, legs, and abdomen.

"You're fine. It's just allergies. Here's a prescription for zyrtec." - I already took zyrtec everyday and just told her that. I had Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Erlichiosis and ALL my blood counts were low so I was severely anemic.

"It’s just anxiety." - Ok well I wouldn’t keep retuning to ER to seek help because I’m so debilitated by it my body’s attacking itself this is the last dump I want to be in.

"That's not a migraine. They only happen on one side of your face and if your pain was a 10 that would be like someone coming in here and chopping your leg off." - Well you tell me what my pain is then because I just begged my fiance in the car to chop my head off so I could get some relief. My brain feels swollen and if I cry or throw up it makes it feel like it's about to pop out of my eye sockets.

“You’re just stressed”

"You have body image issues"... and sent me home from hospital while my legs where 4 times their size, weighing 7kg more than 24h prior, with purple-blue skin that was visibly lacerating and I couldn't walk.

"You just want attentuon" when I had an abscess so big in my throat that I almost lost my hearing and vision and could have un-alived if I didn't present to the ER for 6 times in a row (couldn't talk nor swallow)

... or "there's nothing wrong with you" when I have since been diagnosed with over a dozen chronic degenerative conditions that "rule" my life... "if you don't take the spicy injection you'll un-unalive" when it almost un-alived me and caused me to develop a conpletely new set of conditions...

"Just donate blood you’ll feel better."

"Food doesn't do that."

‘We don’t recognise that notion, you need to speak to your private doctor.’ - As I’m reporting pain in my ears and throat, heart racing, painful GI symptoms, and extreme anxiety

“You’re just sensitive” - Turns out I was having allergic reactions to everything.

"i see you have contact with a therapist. Problems and symtoms can often SEEM to be physical even tho they are psychological" And "I don't want to treat your physical disorders, they will go away when you feel better in your soul. Until then I will prescribe epi and betapred if you ever get anaphylaxis again" *After explaining I have had apoximatly 5 anafylaxic reaction a week for the past month and am in unbearable pain from mast-related stomach issues... I "thretend" with getting a second opinion and suddenly she could prescribe Xolair, cromolyn sodium, Innovair, montelukast, antihistamins etc😅

"That’s very rare. I doubt you have that."

“You need to come in every time you have a lot of pain.” - My pain was every day.

“That’s not possible “



"You're definitely a unusual patient, I've never seen anyone have reactions to that medication."

"You have chronic mental illness because you describe issues all over the board"

"You're just stressed" - Then I had a heart attack due to histamines.


When it comes to MCAS just blank stares honestly. Like M-what?
I’ve been fortunate to mostly only see docs that I knew were EDS+ friendly so I haven’t had to deal too much with doctors like that.
I did recently have an ENT ask me to do my hEDS party tricks. 🚩🚩🚩
I had an upper cervical chiropractor tell me I didn’t have CCI when I knew I did Then I got dx with it lol he’s nice though. He just didn’t understand. He was thinking cervical instability which is different.
I had a neurologist tell me he also didn’t think I had CCI before I got my dx but was absolutely willing to test for it. He still didn’t believe I had it but was extremely kind about it and never outright told me I was wrong. Just said his radiologist didn’t see it and asked if I would be willing to be tested for small fiber neuropathy (ironically I have that too haha). I gave him info on CCI and he was genuinely grateful for it and told me so. 🙂
Had a doc during my new patient exam once see my piece of paper with my “laundry list” as I said to her and laughed. Then said “I do not have time for all that but we will see what we can do!” Then set a timer right in front of me. 😒
I’ve definitely had to push like mad for everything I wanted but other than that 🤷🏻‍♀️
I’m sorry for all these docs and what they’ve said. 🙁

I wasn't fine.

What you're describing sounds consistent with histamine intolerance, not MCAS.
Some of the ways to differentiate are what you're already doing really well: track any triggers and reaction times.

Histamine intolerance generally phases in approximately 20-30 minutes or so after eating, because that's how long it takes for the body to ingest histamine. Reactions are generally proportionate, meaning that a low-histamine diet helps, diamine oxidate helps because it helps break down histamine, etc.

MCAS is very different because it's chaotic and hyper-reactive. Triggers can seemingly come out of nowhere, and the body reactions are generally very rapid, potentially severe, and totally out of proportion to any immediate threat. Anaphylaxis is a common symptom. Histamine dumps are a common system, which can feel like massive panic attacks.

MCAS differs a lot by person, so it's prudent to look at it as a possibility. But don't delay treatment of your daughter's actual symptoms, all of which sound like they align with histamine intolerance, plus as you mention SIBO/SIFO, and potentially some allergies.

Definitions of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid events …

Anaphylaxis is defined as an immediate systemic reaction caused by rapid, IgE-mediated immune release of potent mediators from tissue mast cells and peripheral blood basophils.

Anaphylactoid reactions are immediate systemic reactions that mimic anaphylaxis but are not caused by IgE-mediated immune responses.

Ambient ultrafine particle (PM0.1)

The problem of ultrafine particles (UFPs; PM0.1) has been prevalent since the past decades. In addition to become easily inhaled by human respiratory system due to their ultrafine diameter (<100 nm)
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393512202388X

 Particulate Matter 


Among the harmful air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM) is indirectly responsible for millions of premature deaths due to prolonged exposure effects. To date, PM is categorized based on its particle diameter into coarse, fine, and ultrafine.

Diameter of < 10μm = coarse = PM10

Diameter of < 2.5μm = fine = PM2.5 

Diameter of < 0.1μm = ultrafine = PM0.1
	
The ultrafine particles (UFP) are also known as atmospheric nanoparticles.

Ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) are often formed through the dynamic photochemistry processes of low-volatility gas compounds. Emissions from unfinished fuel combustion, biomass burning, industrial emissions, and volcanic activities, may also contribute as primary sources.

Due to their very small diameter size, UFPs are easily inhaled by human respiratory system and could penetrate further into pulmonary alveoli. Furthermore, their wide surface area may promote higher lung deposition rate which lead to an increased level of UFPs toxicity. In typical cases, exposure to UFPs may promote higher chance of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases owing to UFPs ability to instigate pulmonary accumulation and systemic translocation in the body system 

Rsearch have identified strong correlations between ambient UFPs exposure and particularly severe diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems.

Due to their very small diameter size, UFPs are easily in

# Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE)

Source: https://int-enviroguard.com/blog/filtration-efficiency-the-difference-between-bfe-pfe-and-vfe/

Bacterial filtration efficiency testing assesses how well a particular material filters out bacteria. It is used to determine compliance with specific standards including ASTM F2100, ASTM F2101, and EN 14683. This is the basic standard for the type of material used in medical-grade face masks.

During a BFE test, a part of the fabric is securely clamped between a special cascade impactor and an aerosol chamber. A specific bacterium, usually staphylococcus aureus, is added to the aerosol chamber and is then drawn through the mask using a vacuum.

Test personnel then check the number of bacterial colonies that have passed through the material. This test is repeated several times to determine a comparative average of how the fabric performs. The material is then given a rating based on the test results. Generally, BFE measures how well a material protects against live bacteria particles that measure from one to five microns.


# Particle Filtration Efficiency

Source: https://int-enviroguard.com/blog/filtration-efficiency-the-difference-between-bfe-pfe-and-vfe/

Particle filtration efficiency (PFE) is essentially the same concept as BFE, but the tests are performed differently.

Instead of bacteria, the material is tested against an aerosol of a specific particulate, such as a harmful fume, dust, or other airborne particulates. Non-living bacteria are sometimes used, as well. Generally, a high-level PFE material blocks non-viable particles ranging in size from 0.1 microns to one micron.

After several tests, researchers then determine how well the material filtered out or blocked the substance. The better the filtration ability, the higher grade the mask material receives.

PFE standards aren’t usually as strict as medical-grade tests, but they are still incredibly important. Most industrial respirators, filters (HEPA: High-Efficiency Particulate Air), and face masks are at the very least held to specific PFE standards and/or ratings.


Viral Filtration Efficiency (VFE)

Viral filtration efficiency (VFE) is nearly identical to PFE and BFE. The biggest difference is that a specific virus is used in aerosol form instead of bacteria or particulates.

VFE is exceptionally important in high-grade medical masks when blocking out viruses like COVID-19, influenza, and others is incredibly crucial.

Why have a separate form of VFE instead of just using BFE? The two tests generally go hand-in-hand, with VFE being the lesser-used approach. Generally, a material that does well during the BFE test will also perform high on the VFE test.

The KIT D816V mutation is considered the most common pathogenic driver of systemic mastocytosis (SM).

- The KIT D816V mutation is considered as a (specific) diagnostic marker of SM, regardless of the subtype of the disease, and is one of the four minor criteria required by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of SM.

- The KIT D816V allele burden correlates with the variant of mastocytosis, predicts survival, and is a valuable follow-up parameter in SM. The KIT D816V allele burden also correlates significantly with serum tryptase levels.


KIT D816V allele burden categorization:

* 0.042% (range 0.005%-0.530%): cutaneous mastocytosis (CM)
* 0.084% (range 0.029%-0.165%): mastocytosis in the skin (MIS)
* 0.285% (range 0.006%-34.585%): indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM)
* 3.761% (range 0.083%-50.183%): SM with an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD)
* 5.991% (range 0.023%-29.620%): smoldering systemic mastocytosis (SSM) 
* 9.346% (range 8.816%-32.480%): aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM)




Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal haematopoietic stem cell disease typically characterized by the expansion and accumulation of neoplastic mast cells carrying the activating KIT D816V as a driver mutation. 


Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare hematologic disease characterized by an abnormal expansion and accumulation of pathological mast cells (MCs) in skin and/or other several extracutaneous tissues such as bone marrow (BM) and the gastro-intestinal tract. Currently, SM is divided into five different diagnostic subtypes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification [1]. These include indolent SM (ISM), smouldering SM (SSM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated haematological neoplasms (SM-AHN) and MC leukaemia (MCL). Additionally, the inclusion of two new subtypes of SM into the classification of the disease is currently under consideration: a variant of ISM known as BM mastocytosis (BMM) , which is characterized by a low BM MC burden in the absence of skin lesions, and a very rare (<5%) variant of mastocytosis, which shows tumour mast cells (MCs) with a well-differentiated morphology together with a CD25− CD2− immunophenotype and unique clinical, biological and molecular features, termed well-differentiated SM (WDSM) [4]. From a prognostic point of view, all these diagnostic subtypes of SM can be grouped into (i) non-advanced forms of SM (Non-AdvSM), which include BMM, ISM and SSM, typically characterized by a more stable and indolent course of the disease and a life expectancy similar or close to that of a sex- and age-matched population; and (ii) advanced SM (AdvSM) including ASM, SM-AHN and MCL, which typically display an adverse prognosis associated with a significantly shortened life expectancy requiring cytoreductive therapy [1]. Despite this, some ISM patients (<5%) can eventually evolve to SSM and AdvSM [5]. Conversely, a small proportion of AdvSM patients may also show a relatively stable disease course over years or even decades [6,7].


Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow give rise to blood cells and mast cells. Differentiating HSCs progress through a number of intermediate progenitors with multilineage-forming capacity before commitment to the mast cell lineage The binding of stem cell factor (SCF) to its receptor, KIT, promotes the maturation and proliferation of mast cells.

 It is therefore not surprising that mutations in the KIT gene coincide with the mast cell-driven disease systemic mastocytosis (SM) [7].

Has your doctor talked with you about the problems with those drugs and mast cells?

Escitalopram (brand name Lexapro) belongs to a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin) belongs to a class of drugs called norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs).

In general, reuptake inhibitors have been shown to worsen MCAS through the suspected mechanism of stimulating histamine release from mast cells.

Instead, ask your doctor about switching to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Research on TCAs has shown a consistent beneficial effect on MCAS, because of inhibition of serotonin secretion and also prevention of mast cell degranulation by lowering levels of intracellular calcium.

No no with the pineapple. What I consider to be the safest fruits:
Red Delicious Apple
Bosc or Bartlett Pear
Mango (Med Salicylate)
Peaches
Nectarines (Mast Cell Stabiliser)
Cherries (makes sure they are RED! Not Purple! That’s too overripe).
Lychee
High antioxidant usually mean high salicylate. Berries are usually in this category, so even though they are low histamine it’s still a no for my self as I have Salicylate and Oxalate problems.
DO NOT EAT : Banana, Pineapple, Citrus, Melons. These are off the table when it comes to low histamine

Apples are lower in histamine and are a natural source of quercetin, a mast cell stabilizer. I’ve had good luck with blueberries, blackberries, melon, cranberries, cherries, and peaches.

 am ok with Peaches/nectarines, oranges, mandarins, tangerines, mango, cherries, papaya, banana, watermelon, organic grapes, blueberries, blackberries. I react to strawberries, pineapple & apples. If you have sensitivity/allergies to salicylates you will react to quercetin & apples except for one variety I believe.


 Personally I can do apples, pears, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries (NOT strawberries), mango and sometimes watermelon

A CH50% test  measures the amount and activity of all the major complement proteins. These are labeled C1 through C9. If the results are outside normal levels, the doctor can measure each of the nine different components to understand your deficiencies.

CH50% stands for "classical pathway hemolytic complement assay 50% lysis".

AH50% stands for "alternative pathway hemolytic complement assay 50% lysis".

50% Haemolytic Complement (CH50) 

Low results may mean you have one of the following conditions: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, cirrhosis, kidney disease, hereditary angioedema, malnutrition, a recurrent infection (usually bacterial).

High results may mean you have one of the following conditions: certain types of cancer such as leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or ulcerative colitis.

When IgG subclass 2 levels are elevated, it suggests an abnormal immune response, which can be caused by various factors.

Potential Causes and Associated Conditions:

→ Chronic Infections: 

    Bacterial Infections: Chronic bacterial infections, particularly those involving encapsulated bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae), can lead to elevated IgG2 levels. This is due to the body's ongoing response to polysaccharide antigens.
    Other Infections: Persistent viral or fungal infections can also stimulate IgG2 production as part of a broader immune response.

→ Autoimmune Diseases:

    Conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders can result in elevated IgG2 levels due to the body's immune system mistakenly targeting its own tissues.

→ Allergic Reactions:

    Although IgG4 is more commonly associated with allergies, chronic allergic conditions and long-term antigen exposure can sometimes lead to an increase in IgG2 levels as part of an overall immune dysregulation.

→ Immunodeficiency Disorders:

    Paradoxically, certain primary immunodeficiency disorders, like Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), may present with elevated IgG2 levels as part of a compensatory mechanism in response to recurrent infections.

→ Chronic Inflammatory Conditions:

    Conditions such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can involve elevated IgG2 levels due to ongoing inflammation and immune activation.

Given what a massive proportion of the population has the MTHFR mutation, are you claiming all of those people have MCAS?
Can you provide any data whatsoever to support this?

Elise Potenza not claiming that all people with MTHFR have MCAS, however, many people with the MTHFR mutation have MCAS. Some people with MTHFR may not even present illness. I reccomend doing research to find your own sources, but their is alot of research data on the web.

Brodie Claire non-professionals make claims that the MTHFR gene does this, that, or the other. It's been blamed for autism, EDS, and tons of other things that are easily disproven. 40% of people have it and most are not "treating" it so whatever claim is being made, roughly 40% of people will have that complication, and that's simply not MCAS.

Here’s what i don’t understand. I have the MTHFR gene. How come my b vitamin panel on a blood test always comes back ok?? It’s not too high or too low. I am not saying your wrong, but this disease causes me to have horrible anxiety. Because of this I am afraid to add anything to the mix. When i take B vitamins of any kind for more than 3 days, I get worse whether they are methylated or not. It’s frustrating. Vitamin D if any kind does the same thing. I am so miserable but all the traditional stuff doesn’t work….

I don't think we actually know what causes MCAS and I suspect it's different things for different people. Those who do have MTHFR mutation (I only have the half-mutation) do need to be careful about the kinds of B vitamins we're getting. But I don't think there is a single foundational answer to "why MCAS?" yet.

You need methylated vitamins for MTHFR, right? Are they safe to take if you DON'T have MTHFR? Just curious.

I don’t think you can claim “almost always” because there just isn’t enough research—especially with all of these people that are saying it was triggered by mold and covid. Did those things cause it? Did they just turn it on? Nobody knows. It’s just way too new and these types of pop science books REALLY need to be read with a grain of salt.
Unfortunately medicine and bodies are extremely complicated so there’s never a fix-all solution. Medical issues mimic others. They have different causes. While this is great to post as a personal experience that may help others, offering guarantees just can’t be done.

I have MCAS and tested negative for both mthfr mutations. So while I think that gene mutation causes alot of problems, it doesn't necessarily mean that its the cause of mcas.

Yeah, I’m calling BS on this, sorry. I’ve been tested twice for MTHFR and I don’t have it but I do have MCAS. This whole post just reads like the ramblings of a person that wants to sound smart. There’s not a single source listed to back up any of claims you made, probably because you know you can’t find any.

Hey guys just wanted to post a generalized response. I am not a medical professional, but have done tons of research over several years. A better way to phrase my comment from earlier might be that MOST MCAS cases are tied to MTHFR, that doesn't mean all. However this is hugely connected. Personally I have gone through HELL on Earth battling this and watching my loved ones suffer from different genetic variations that have been greatly mis-understood or overlooked. My daughter was born with Down Syndrome and passed away at 5 years old. This grief, along with some of my other illnesses and a weird dental mutation only my sister and I had, plus Autistic nephews sent me down a path of studying my family genetics. When I was a child I was always sick and having weird reactions, bouts of Alopecia sometimes very severe to where I would have to hide my head from other children to avoid bullying. Always very sensetive to food and smells. After the grief of my daughter passing my allergies amplified tenfold to the point of anaphalaxysis. Also I have EDS and suffer from reccurent should dislocation which is probably the most painful physical part of all of this. All of the suffering has forced me to fight for my life and seek healing. I will try to answer each of you over the next day in between working. My sole purpose in this post is to try and share some insight that has truly helped me and saved my life. I understand there is no one size fits all glove and every single person has there own unique path. That is why I feel genetic testing and diving in to understand yourself on the most basic level is crucial to healing. None of us will have the same results, but some will have common threads. I got my test from https://nutritiongenome.com/shop-nutrition-genome/ref/701/. I think 23 and me also does them. I am not sure which is better, but this report really helped me. I take some of the diet reccommendations with a grain of salt with all my allergies, but I do supplement accordingly, and most of all it has identified several problem gene mutations even beyond MTHFR. I do not have all the answers but I encourage you to do your own research on this subject if you want to learn more, I will try to provide some good resources with some data as a follow up too. Thank you all for your responses, even the skeptics! I respect anyone who has a healthy skepticism too, because honestly we have been force fed a bunch of BS non-sense our whole lives about what is best for us and it is a way of self-preservation to be skeptical. So absolutely encourage you to not take my word for it alone and do your own research. Hope you each find a reason to overcome today, because if pain and death can't stop me from fighting, to smile, then you can find it in you. ❤️

Getting tested from your doctor for MTHFR is totally reasonable! It is important to note that some with the mutation don’t have issues with folate, it depends on what variant you test positive for and if you have a single or double copy. But if you get tested with your doctor they should explain all of that. Like everything, it is not one size fits all.

I agree. I'm homozygous C677t. Has caused me so many issues. Cannot detox histamine, estrogen, etc. Caused me to have a stroke due to blood clots with extremely high homocysteine levels. Estrogen dominance with endometriosis, ovarian cysts, pots, sibo, etc. So many health issues. TMG brings the level down some, but not into optimal range.

I've not found any academic papers on MTHFR and MCAS, but there is a link between MTHFR and hEDS. These people do tend to benefit from cutting out folic acid and taking a methylated form of folate. The peer-reviewed study can be read here: https://fasciainstitute.org/folate-deficient.../....

If you guys get your homocysteine levels checked, and they are fine, you don't need to get checked for mthfr. If they are off, then yes. Your b vitamins, etc, can show upas fine but if your homocysteine levels aren't then blood results are wrong. It's documented this happens. It's on several lectures from peer reviewed doctors from eds society

I think that MCAS is triggered by a toxic overload and that this is what we have in common. That said, many people with MCAS have a problem with MTHFR because these polymorphisms make them more likely to become toxic, but others can also develop this problem without having the polymorphism. I think any toxic person with MTHFR can improve their health by working MTHFR to make the body function better. We need to detoxify ourselves. Thank you for your positive sharing!

It’s disappointing that another member of the group is questioning the validity of the links between these conditions. It’s not all pseudoscience. For me personally it has been a long journey to multiple specialists. It took years to arrive here in this group for MCAS. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that these conditions show strong correlation. I was first diagnosed autistic long before genetic testing showed I carry the MTHFR mutation. I only recently arrived at MCAS after years of frustration wondering what the heck is wrong with my body. I appreciate a member willing to post about the links between these conditions because maybe it will help someone else find out faster than the 20 years it took me.
