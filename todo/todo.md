Safe waters: 1. Have you tried mountain valley spring water in the green glass bottle? I know that doesn’t help you right now, but it’s my only safe water. 2. I have recently tried the sparkling water from Trader Joe’s and I think whole food sells it.  It’s a white label and I’ll go look for the name. They have still water too but I haven’t seen that option often Gerolsteiner Is the brand, in glass bottle only

neuroendocrine tumor. asked about MENS


I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying that your recent tests show elevated , and also protein in your urine, but the doctor didn't give an explanation/diagnosis and also didn't schedule a followup this week

Ken Cova: So far antihistamines haven't done much for me either, although I have yet to try some of them. I have seen a good response to a number of the supplements that target the condition: Quercitin, Luteolin, Neuroprotek by Mirica, also to aspirin.

Natalia Barzani:
I travelled from Sweden to the UK, London
I've been seeing prof Simmonds, prof Khullar and prof Birchall. 
For MCAS and EDS prof Khullar is excellent and diagnosed me. 
For EDS prof Simmonds most definitely her. 
If your sister needs PT I'd recommend Julie Griffis American PT, via Telehealth.
 I'm going to continue PT for life as it has done so much for me. Julie is excellent.

Long Covid (LC), 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), 
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), 
Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), 
Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), and 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) are all loosely connected, 
some poorly defined, some with overlapping symptoms. 

The female preponderance, the prominence of fatigue and chronic inflammation,
and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) abnormalities may connect them
all. Indeed differential methylation may lie at the root. Two - EDS and MTHFR -
are genetic. But epigenetic factors may ultimately determine their phenotypic
expression. Oxidative stress, overloaded mitochondria, an antioxidant and
nutrient shortfall, and suboptimal gut microbiome appear to be the primary
determinants. A deep dive into [folate metabolism] and [methionine metabolism]
is undertaken in an attempt to connect these syndromes. The active forms of
vitamin D and vitamins B2,3,6,9,12 are shown to be biochemically integral to
optimal methylation and control of the epigenome. Their status largely
determines the symptoms of abnormal MTHFR in all its phenotypes. The wider
implications for aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative
disease, and autoimmune disease are briefly explored.

## Diagnostics


### Nose-throat scope

Do nose-throat scope testing. This can be done by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist or head-neck specialist:

- [ ] Test for acid reflux, structural abnormalities, GERD, EoS, etc.

  - Typically this can be done by using a nose-throat scope during a routine office visit.

If testing turns up acid issues:

- [ ] Rx antacid, such as famotidine (a.k.a. brand name Pepcid).

  - In addition to decreasing acid, famotidine is a histamine-2 blocker (H2 blocker).

If testing turns up structural anomalies:

- [ ] Do a head-neck CT scan with contrast.

  - This is to rule out problems such as throat cancer.


### Gut tox screen

Gut toxin screening by an internal medicine specialist or similar immunology specialist.

Aim for comprehensive testing of GI toxins:

- [ ] Test for mycotoxins in urine.

  - A comprehensive test includes 40+ items.

  - A company that offers this testing is [Mosaic DX](https://mosaicdx.com)

* [The Impact of Food Histamine Intake on Asthma Activity: A Pilot Study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/11/3402)


### Histamine symptom management

Daily medications:

- [ ] Montelukast (a.k.a. brand name Singulair) (Rx)

- [ ] Morning & evening H1 + H2 oral antihistamines (OTC)

- [ ] Morning & evening nasal sprays

Also:

- [ ] Adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) emergency auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen)


### Anti-fungal herbal agents

[5 Herbal Agents for Antifungal Therapy](https://mosaicdx.com/resource/5-herbal-agents-for-antifungal-therapy/)

- [ ] Goldenseal a.k.a. Hydrastis canadensis

- [ ] Black Walnut a.k.a. Juglans nigra

- [ ] Echinacea a.k.a. Echinacea purpurea

- [ ] Grapefruit seed extract

- [ ] Garlic a.k.a. Allium sativum


## Allergy testing

Allergy testing a.k.a. histamine-response testing can be done by an allergy specialist or similar immunology specialist.

- [ ] Do comprehensive skin prick panels for flora, fauna, chemicals, etc.

  - This includes 400+ items.

  - This is more comprehensive and more accurate than typical allergy blood tests.

  - This is best done after a week or so without taking any antihistamines, because antihistamines tend to interfere with the skin prick testing.


## Gut cleanse

Gut bile cleaning via bile acid sequestrants.

- [ ] Cholestyramine (Rx) is a popular choice, and also helps lower cholesterol.

- [ ] Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol) (Rx) is a similar choice, and may be better-tolerated.

- [ ] Activated charcoal (OTC) is a similar choice, and may be stronger and faster.

Estimate 2-4 weeks to feel results.

### # Reverse osmosis

Water may contain things that are unsafe to drink: examples are toxins, hormones, microplastics, contaminants, carcinogens, pathogens.

Reverse osmosis is one of the only ways to effectively remove PFAS from water. 


* chlorine
* fluoride
* lead
* arsenic
* bacteria
* viruses
* nitrates
* prescription drug residue
* pesticides
* PFAS

germicidal UVC lamps 


Stage 1: A mechanical filter that removes larger particles like sediment and rust.

Stage 2: A carbon filter that removes chlorine and chloramines.

Stage 3: A reverse osmosis membrane that removes lead, chromium 6, arsenic, uranium, nitrates, and must more.

Stage 4: An activated coconut block filter which removes volatile organic compounds, rocket fuel, prescription drug residue, herbicides, pesticides, and PFAS.

UV lights sterilize bacteria so it cannot reproduce. It doesn't kill it outright.

UV light treatment can’t remove gases, heavy metals, and particulates.

1. Bacteria are killed by ultraviolet light

The step involves removing all bacteria from your tap water through UV filtration. UV bacteria removal is a process that uses ultraviolet light to destroy bacteria.
2. Removal of bacteria through carbon block filters

This step traps bacteria, viruses and other organic molecules, such as chlorine, volatile organics, herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides.



PFAS “forever chemicals.” 

Certification examples: IAPMO to NSF standards to remove 83 of the most
dangerous chemicals and toxins in your tap water, including lead, arsenic,
chlorine, flouride, nitrates, PFOS, PFOA, and more.


According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) there are up to 7500 contaminants found in tap water. Out of these 7500, the EPA has identified 600 that they believe may represent a public health concern. Despite this, the EPA currently regulates less than 100 contaminants and has not updated the water safety rules for over thirty years. There are three types of contaminants in water: organic and inorganic chemicals and biological contaminants. 


Some contaminants are molecularly smaller than water, so can slip through a typical reverse osmosis filter: pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, certain dissolved gasses such as hydrogen sulfide, certain organic compounds, chlorine, etc.

Reverse osmosis may remove various quantities of chlorine, but there is a possibility that the average home RO filter may not have the capacity to capture all the chlorine present in water. This will largely depend on the chemical’s concentrations in the water supply.

Fluoride molecules are larger than water molecules, so reverse osmosis will filter out fluoride effectively.

Reverse Osmosis technology is effective at filtering out most forms of bacteria. 

Activated carbon filter

Small household reverse osmosis systems typically do not have any chemical cleaning cycle, so bacteria can grow in the piping, tank, and downstream because there is not going to be a chlorine residual. 

Bacteria can find a way through filtration all of the time. Even if the efficacy of a filter is 99%, it is not a matter of 'if', but 'when'. Disinfection is the ONLY way to destroy bacteria in water treatment. RO is not disinfection. 

UVC light emits a high-frequency, shortwave electromagnetic radiation alters DNA
which renders cells unable to replicate. This inactivation of the microbes
causes cell death, mutations, and failure to reproduce thus rendering cells
harmless. 

UVC radiation is highly effective at eliminating many types of bacteria including drug-resistant bacteria called superbugs, viruses including many types of flu strains, beta coronaviruses including MERS, SARS, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Some of the most stubborn bacteria that UVC light is proven to eliminate include:

• MRSA (Methicillin-Resistand Staphylococcus Aureus)
• Salmonella
• ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli)Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE)
• Clostridium difficile
• Multidrug-resistant pseudomonas
• Carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC)

UVC light effectively eliminates these types of bacteria and many others up to 99.99%, as reported in this study regarding the effectiveness of ultraviolet air and surface disinfection systems.

Diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome

The diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome presents many challenges.

Firstly, MCAS causes a multitude of symptoms and signs. The commonest are these:

Skin writing (Dermatographia) (76%)
Pain all over the body (Fibromyalgia) (75%)
Near fainting and fainting (71%)
Headache (63%)
Itching/nettle rash (urticaria) (63%)
Tingling (58%)
Nausea/vomiting (57%)
Chills (56%)
Skin swelling that moves around the body (56%)
Eye irritation (53%)
Breathlessness (53%)
Gastrointestinal reflux (50%)
Cognitive dysfunction (49%)
Rashes (49%)
Abdominal pain (48%)
Throat irritation (48%)
Palpitations (47%)
Sweats (47%)
Environmental allergies (40%)
Fever (40%)
Non-anginal pain (40%)


Consensus 2 criteria, in simplified form, for diagnosis of MCAS:

Major criteria:

1: Constellation of clinical symptoms attributable to increased mast cell activation

Minor criteria:

1: Demonstration of excessive numbers of mast cells on biopsy

2: Expression of CD2 +or- CD25 in blood, marrow or other organs

3: Atypical appearance of at least 25% of mast cells on biopsy

4: Detection of activating mutations in mast cells

5: Evidence (serum, plasma, or urine) of above-normal levels of mast cell mediators including:

    tryptase
    histamine or its metabolites (e.g., N-methylhistamine)
    heparin
    chromogranin A (note potential confounders of cardiac or renal failure, neuroendocrine tumours, recent proton pump inhibitor use, or chronic atrophic gastritis)
    other relatively specific mast cell specific mediators

6: Symptomatic response to inhibitors of mast cell activation

Diagnosis established upon demonstration of the major criterion combined with at least one minor criterion.

In clinical practice it is, therefore, possible to diagnose MCAS on the strength of a typical history, and response to mast cell antagonists such as H1 and H2 antagonists, Mast Cell Stabilisers, Leukotriene antagonists, or other medications used for MCAS. However, demonstration of mast cell activators  – usually serum chromogranin A, urinary prostaglandin D2 or urinary N-methylhistamine – adds even greater strength to the diagnosis.

Unfortunately, these tests are not routinely available on the NHS in the UK, though, as serum Chromogranin A is used as a marker for neuroendocrine cancer, some NHS laboratories may permit its measurement in suspected MCAS. Some private laboratories offer  serum chromogranin A, urinary prostaglandins and urinary N-methylhistamine.

Demonstration of elevated numbers of mast cells by using CD117 staining of intestinal biopsies further strengthens a diagnosis of MCAS. Sadly, use of CD117 staining for this purpose is not widely available in the UK.

Povidone-Iodine (BETADINE®) 

Marcons treatment: I usually do it on my bed and lay on my back with my head off the bed. I very slowly fill up the sinuses in this position and then set a timer for 2 minutes. Then I plug my nose with my fingers and turn over onto my belly kind of shimmying off the bed til my head hits the floor and unplug- that gets into the sinuses in our forehead. I time that for another 2 minutes. It’s not for everyone but it sure does get everywhere into the sinus cavities. I keep a towel right by too and when I come back up I just let all of the liquid drain onto the towel. Most of it comes out quickly but sometimes you’ll get delayed emptying for up to 30 min later.

###

In general, the priority order is:

1. Triggers in your environment that continue to harm you. Some triggers are easy to see, such as black mold behind a dishwasher. Some triggers are impossible to see, such as volatile organic compounds. Try wearing a face mask that has organic vapor relief, even indoors as much as you can, even when you sleep. If you can tolerate a painters' respirator that's what I did. If you need something simpler get a 3M Particulate Respirator 8577, P95, with Nuisance Level Organic Vapor Relief. What are you trying along these lines so far, such as for exposure minimization?

2. Stuff that's inside you and needs to come out, such as any mold, toxins, infections. There are medical tests for these kinds of problems, and in your other post you mention you have an appointment about these; that's good. In the meantime, for ongoing mold inside you, read about bile acid sequestrants such as activated charcoal. I take it. It's harsh yet works. It sucks up nutrients though, so take it a few hours away from any food or meds. What are you trying along these lines, such as detoxifiers, gut healers, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, etc.?

3. Stuff you're putting inside you. This covers things like foods with allergens such as gluten or dairy, or triggers such as artificial colors and flavors, or triggers such as oxalates or salicylates, or compounds such as histamines or histamine releasers, or chemicals in your tap water, etc. Read about these. You wrote about losing lots of weight, so aim for anything to get calories and protein into you; the safest foods are arborio rice and very fresh organic chicken that's skinned and boiled and eaten immediately. Also look at elemental shakes and nutrition shakes from Kate Farms and Neocate Splash. Many people get good results from supplements, such as diamine oxidase and/or quercetin. What are you doing for nutrition and supplements?

4. Stuff that's hurt in you and needs healing. This is where MCAS really matters because most researchers believe it's damage to the limbic system that causes disregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Stress reduction tactics can help some people a lot. Read about EMDR for trauma, SAAT for acupuncture, DNRS for limbic system reset. What are you doing and trying so far about stress reductions?

As air flows through the charcoal, the things being carried along with the air either get stuck inside the charcoal, thus filtering it out of the air and ensuring it doesn't make it to your lungs. 

not be a big, smooth block, but instead a hollow one with . That just increases the surface area and effectiveness of it. Legitimate companies, such as 3M, do a much better job at this and make a much better product than others. 

When you put a respirator on your face, it's supposed to be an air-tight fit. (If you have an ill-fitting respirator or if you have a lot of facial hair, for example, then it's not air-tight.) A good respirator will have the charcoal filters covered by a "pre-filter". If it's on correctly, then everything you breathe should be going through the pre-filter (filtering out that "dust"), then through the charcoal (filtering out gases). This is the next-best thing to simply not breathing any of it at all, aka: venting all the gases outside... which some people can't do because of their environment and setup, which I understand. 

 Honeywell but you want the "organic vapor" cartridges 

Which color cartridge mask to use against in organic gases and vapors? The cartridge has been assigned the color code “Yellow” in the NIOSH system. Breathing organic vapors or acid gases can pose a risk to your health.

FFP stands for “Filtering Facepiece”. The number 1 to 3 describes the protection level of the respiratory mask. The higher the number, the more efficiently the mask filters particles such as dust or airborne liquid particles from the air.

How long does a 3M FFP3 mask last?
How long can FFP3 masks be worn for? FFP3 masks are tested to ensure they remain effective. Provided the seal remains intact, they can be worn comfortably for at least two hours but are effective for longer unless compromised, e.g. splashed with body fluids, damp with respiration.


FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3 masks protect from fine airborne pollutants such as dust and aerosols or - in the case of FFP3 masks – also viruses. These masks are made of high-quality filter material and fit closely to the face in order to achieve the high filter performance necessary. Certified FFP masks are considered personal protective equipment (PPE) and meet the requirements of the European Standard for FFP’s EN 149. Masks without an exhalation valve can also prevent the wearer from spreading exhaled droplets and saliva. Some FFP masks without a valve are therefore additionally tested and approved as medical products according to EN 14683.

Surgical masks primarily prevent the wearer from spreading droplets and saliva when exhaling. The masks themselves offer protection against liquid splashes such as blood, but not from fine aerosols. The medical products, also known as surgical masks, are tested and approved according to EN 14683.


The European safety standard EN 149 provides for two types of FFP respirators:

    FFP masks labelled "NR" (non reusable) are intended for single use for an 8-hour shift.
    FFP masks labelled "R" (reusable) can be reused. They have a sealing lip that can be cleaned and disinfected.

    Regarding keywords to search for, look for ‘nuisance’ odour/vapour respirators. These tend to be R95 or above, and they’re probably the best bet for your situation. I hope this helps!


    VOCs, because they are gases, are about 1000 times smaller than what HEPA filters can capture. Additionally, VOCs do not stick to HEPA filters, so they are unable to deal with any that might be present in the air. Instead, look for additional technology like carbon or PECO that is partnered with the HEPA filter.


    Investigations into volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from polymer fleeces used in particle filtering half masks were conducted and evaluated against the German hygienic guide value for total volatile organic compounds and the “Lowest Concentration of Interest” for construction products. All masks showed emission of Xylene. In 94 % of samples, up to 24 additional aromatic compounds were found. 17 % of samples showed terpenes, 53 % emitted aldehydes, 77 % exhibited caprolactam and 98 % released siloxanes. All masks exceeded the TVOC hygienic guidance value level 5 of 10 mg/m³. Emission levels were investigated for masks immediately after their packages were opened and for masks that were “vented” for two weeks. Further, the emissions were repeatedly measured to investigate the decrease of emissions. An exponential decline was observed and a fitting function was calculated. The influence of the two commonly gas chromatograph (GC) hyphenated detectors, mass spectrometer (MS) and flame ionization detector (FID) on the VOC quantification, as well as the influence of temperature on the emission of VOCs were investigated.

In an allergic reaction, there is an identifiable antigen. 

- The body's immune system recorgnizes the antigen, and binds it with an antibody called immunoglobin E (IgE). 

- The result is called an "antibody-antigen complex", and it triggers receptors on mast cells and basophils. 

- This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals into the body, and generates the hypersensitivity response. 

Signs, symptoms, and responses are stereotyped based on the location of the reaction.

- If the reaction is localized, then it is stereotyped an allergic reaction.

- If the reaction is systemic, then it is stereotyped as anaphylaxis. 

In contrast, an anaphylactoid reaction occurs in the absence of an antibody-antigen complex. 

- An anaphylactoid reaction does generate mast cell (or basophil) degranulation.

- And does have many of the same signs, symptoms, and responses, as anaphylaxis.

Many adverse reactions to drugs, or drug hypersensitivies, are actually anaphylactoid reactions and not true allergies. 


The preponderance of evidence indicates that aerobic or endurance exercise produces a degranulation of mast cells and release of histamine within the exercising skeletal muscle tissue, and there does not appear to be an exercise antigen. Thus, exercise satisfies the criteria for being a localized anaphylactoid reaction within the exercised skeletal muscle tissue, rather than an allergic reaction.
