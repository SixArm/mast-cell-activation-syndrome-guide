Safe waters: 1. Have you tried mountain valley spring water in the green glass bottle? I know that doesn’t help you right now, but it’s my only safe water. 2. I have recently tried the sparkling water from Trader Joe’s and I think whole food sells it.  It’s a white label and I’ll go look for the name. They have still water too but I haven’t seen that option often Gerolsteiner Is the brand, in glass bottle only

neuroendocrine tumor. asked about MENS


I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying that your recent tests show elevated , and also protein in your urine, but the doctor didn't give an explanation/diagnosis and also didn't schedule a followup this week

Ken Cova: So far antihistamines haven't done much for me either, although I have yet to try some of them. I have seen a good response to a number of the supplements that target the condition: Quercitin, Luteolin, Neuroprotek by Mirica, also to aspirin.

Natalia Barzani:
I travelled from Sweden to the UK, London
I've been seeing prof Simmonds, prof Khullar and prof Birchall. 
For MCAS and EDS prof Khullar is excellent and diagnosed me. 
For EDS prof Simmonds most definitely her. 
If your sister needs PT I'd recommend Julie Griffis American PT, via Telehealth.
 I'm going to continue PT for life as it has done so much for me. Julie is excellent.

Long Covid (LC), 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), 
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), 
Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), 
Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), and 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) are all loosely connected, 
some poorly defined, some with overlapping symptoms. 

The female preponderance, the prominence of fatigue and chronic inflammation,
and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) abnormalities may connect them
all. Indeed differential methylation may lie at the root. Two - EDS and MTHFR -
are genetic. But epigenetic factors may ultimately determine their phenotypic
expression. Oxidative stress, overloaded mitochondria, an antioxidant and
nutrient shortfall, and suboptimal gut microbiome appear to be the primary
determinants. A deep dive into [folate metabolism] and [methionine metabolism]
is undertaken in an attempt to connect these syndromes. The active forms of
vitamin D and vitamins B2,3,6,9,12 are shown to be biochemically integral to
optimal methylation and control of the epigenome. Their status largely
determines the symptoms of abnormal MTHFR in all its phenotypes. The wider
implications for aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative
disease, and autoimmune disease are briefly explored.

## Diagnostics


### Nose-throat scope

Do nose-throat scope testing. This can be done by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist or head-neck specialist:

- [ ] Test for acid reflux, structural abnormalities, GERD, EoS, etc.

  - Typically this can be done by using a nose-throat scope during a routine office visit.

If testing turns up acid issues:

- [ ] Rx antacid, such as famotidine (a.k.a. brand name Pepcid).

  - In addition to decreasing acid, famotidine is a histamine-2 blocker (H2 blocker).

If testing turns up structural anomalies:

- [ ] Do a head-neck CT scan with contrast.

  - This is to rule out problems such as throat cancer.


### Gut tox screen

Gut toxin screening by an internal medicine specialist or similar immunology specialist.

Aim for comprehensive testing of GI toxins:

- [ ] Test for mycotoxins in urine.

  - A comprehensive test includes 40+ items.

  - A company that offers this testing is [Mosaic DX](https://mosaicdx.com)

* [The Impact of Food Histamine Intake on Asthma Activity: A Pilot Study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/11/3402)


### Histamine symptom management

Daily medications:

- [ ] Montelukast (a.k.a. brand name Singulair) (Rx)

- [ ] Morning & evening H1 + H2 oral antihistamines (OTC)

- [ ] Morning & evening nasal sprays

Also:

- [ ] Adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) emergency auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen)


### Anti-fungal herbal agents

[5 Herbal Agents for Antifungal Therapy](https://mosaicdx.com/resource/5-herbal-agents-for-antifungal-therapy/)

- [ ] Goldenseal a.k.a. Hydrastis canadensis

- [ ] Black Walnut a.k.a. Juglans nigra

- [ ] Echinacea a.k.a. Echinacea purpurea

- [ ] Grapefruit seed extract

- [ ] Garlic a.k.a. Allium sativum


## Allergy testing

Allergy testing a.k.a. histamine-response testing can be done by an allergy specialist or similar immunology specialist.

- [ ] Do comprehensive skin prick panels for flora, fauna, chemicals, etc.

  - This includes 400+ items.

  - This is more comprehensive and more accurate than typical allergy blood tests.

  - This is best done after a week or so without taking any antihistamines, because antihistamines tend to interfere with the skin prick testing.


## Gut cleanse

Gut bile cleaning via bile acid sequestrants.

- [ ] Cholestyramine (Rx) is a popular choice, and also helps lower cholesterol.

- [ ] Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol) (Rx) is a similar choice, and may be better-tolerated.

- [ ] Activated charcoal (OTC) is a similar choice, and may be stronger and faster.

Estimate 2-4 weeks to feel results.

### # Reverse osmosis

Water may contain things that are unsafe to drink: examples are toxins, hormones, microplastics, contaminants, carcinogens, pathogens.

Reverse osmosis is one of the only ways to effectively remove PFAS from water. 


* chlorine
* fluoride
* lead
* arsenic
* bacteria
* viruses
* nitrates
* prescription drug residue
* pesticides
* PFAS

germicidal UVC lamps 


Stage 1: A mechanical filter that removes larger particles like sediment and rust.

Stage 2: A carbon filter that removes chlorine and chloramines.

Stage 3: A reverse osmosis membrane that removes lead, chromium 6, arsenic, uranium, nitrates, and must more.

Stage 4: An activated coconut block filter which removes volatile organic compounds, rocket fuel, prescription drug residue, herbicides, pesticides, and PFAS.

UV lights sterilize bacteria so it cannot reproduce. It doesn't kill it outright.

UV light treatment can’t remove gases, heavy metals, and particulates.

1. Bacteria are killed by ultraviolet light

The step involves removing all bacteria from your tap water through UV filtration. UV bacteria removal is a process that uses ultraviolet light to destroy bacteria.
2. Removal of bacteria through carbon block filters

This step traps bacteria, viruses and other organic molecules, such as chlorine, volatile organics, herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides.



PFAS “forever chemicals.” 

Certification examples: IAPMO to NSF standards to remove 83 of the most
dangerous chemicals and toxins in your tap water, including lead, arsenic,
chlorine, flouride, nitrates, PFOS, PFOA, and more.


According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) there are up to 7500 contaminants found in tap water. Out of these 7500, the EPA has identified 600 that they believe may represent a public health concern. Despite this, the EPA currently regulates less than 100 contaminants and has not updated the water safety rules for over thirty years. There are three types of contaminants in water: organic and inorganic chemicals and biological contaminants. 


Some contaminants are molecularly smaller than water, so can slip through a typical reverse osmosis filter: pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, certain dissolved gasses such as hydrogen sulfide, certain organic compounds, chlorine, etc.

Reverse osmosis may remove various quantities of chlorine, but there is a possibility that the average home RO filter may not have the capacity to capture all the chlorine present in water. This will largely depend on the chemical’s concentrations in the water supply.

Fluoride molecules are larger than water molecules, so reverse osmosis will filter out fluoride effectively.

Reverse Osmosis technology is effective at filtering out most forms of bacteria. 

Activated carbon filter

Small household reverse osmosis systems typically do not have any chemical cleaning cycle, so bacteria can grow in the piping, tank, and downstream because there is not going to be a chlorine residual. 

Bacteria can find a way through filtration all of the time. Even if the efficacy of a filter is 99%, it is not a matter of 'if', but 'when'. Disinfection is the ONLY way to destroy bacteria in water treatment. RO is not disinfection. 

UVC light emits a high-frequency, shortwave electromagnetic radiation alters DNA
which renders cells unable to replicate. This inactivation of the microbes
causes cell death, mutations, and failure to reproduce thus rendering cells
harmless. 

UVC radiation is highly effective at eliminating many types of bacteria including drug-resistant bacteria called superbugs, viruses including many types of flu strains, beta coronaviruses including MERS, SARS, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Some of the most stubborn bacteria that UVC light is proven to eliminate include:

• MRSA (Methicillin-Resistand Staphylococcus Aureus)
• Salmonella
• ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli)Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE)
• Clostridium difficile
• Multidrug-resistant pseudomonas
• Carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC)

UVC light effectively eliminates these types of bacteria and many others up to 99.99%, as reported in this study regarding the effectiveness of ultraviolet air and surface disinfection systems.

Diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome

The diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome presents many challenges.

Firstly, MCAS causes a multitude of symptoms and signs. The commonest are these:

Skin writing (Dermatographia) (76%)
Pain all over the body (Fibromyalgia) (75%)
Near fainting and fainting (71%)
Headache (63%)
Itching/nettle rash (urticaria) (63%)
Tingling (58%)
Nausea/vomiting (57%)
Chills (56%)
Skin swelling that moves around the body (56%)
Eye irritation (53%)
Breathlessness (53%)
Gastrointestinal reflux (50%)
Cognitive dysfunction (49%)
Rashes (49%)
Abdominal pain (48%)
Throat irritation (48%)
Palpitations (47%)
Sweats (47%)
Environmental allergies (40%)
Fever (40%)
Non-anginal pain (40%)


Consensus 2 criteria, in simplified form, for diagnosis of MCAS:

Major criteria:

1: Constellation of clinical symptoms attributable to increased mast cell activation

Minor criteria:

1: Demonstration of excessive numbers of mast cells on biopsy

2: Expression of CD2 +or- CD25 in blood, marrow or other organs

3: Atypical appearance of at least 25% of mast cells on biopsy

4: Detection of activating mutations in mast cells

5: Evidence (serum, plasma, or urine) of above-normal levels of mast cell mediators including:

    tryptase
    histamine or its metabolites (e.g., N-methylhistamine)
    heparin
    chromogranin A (note potential confounders of cardiac or renal failure, neuroendocrine tumours, recent proton pump inhibitor use, or chronic atrophic gastritis)
    other relatively specific mast cell specific mediators

6: Symptomatic response to inhibitors of mast cell activation

Diagnosis established upon demonstration of the major criterion combined with at least one minor criterion.

In clinical practice it is, therefore, possible to diagnose MCAS on the strength of a typical history, and response to mast cell antagonists such as H1 and H2 antagonists, Mast Cell Stabilisers, Leukotriene antagonists, or other medications used for MCAS. However, demonstration of mast cell activators  – usually serum chromogranin A, urinary prostaglandin D2 or urinary N-methylhistamine – adds even greater strength to the diagnosis.

Unfortunately, these tests are not routinely available on the NHS in the UK, though, as serum Chromogranin A is used as a marker for neuroendocrine cancer, some NHS laboratories may permit its measurement in suspected MCAS. Some private laboratories offer  serum chromogranin A, urinary prostaglandins and urinary N-methylhistamine.

Demonstration of elevated numbers of mast cells by using CD117 staining of intestinal biopsies further strengthens a diagnosis of MCAS. Sadly, use of CD117 staining for this purpose is not widely available in the UK.

Povidone-Iodine (BETADINE®) 

Marcons treatment: I usually do it on my bed and lay on my back with my head off the bed. I very slowly fill up the sinuses in this position and then set a timer for 2 minutes. Then I plug my nose with my fingers and turn over onto my belly kind of shimmying off the bed til my head hits the floor and unplug- that gets into the sinuses in our forehead. I time that for another 2 minutes. It’s not for everyone but it sure does get everywhere into the sinus cavities. I keep a towel right by too and when I come back up I just let all of the liquid drain onto the towel. Most of it comes out quickly but sometimes you’ll get delayed emptying for up to 30 min later.

###

In general, the priority order is:

1. Triggers in your environment that continue to harm you. Some triggers are easy to see, such as black mold behind a dishwasher. Some triggers are impossible to see, such as volatile organic compounds. Try wearing a face mask that has organic vapor relief, even indoors as much as you can, even when you sleep. If you can tolerate a painters' respirator that's what I did. If you need something simpler get a 3M Particulate Respirator 8577, P95, with Nuisance Level Organic Vapor Relief. What are you trying along these lines so far, such as for exposure minimization?

2. Stuff that's inside you and needs to come out, such as any mold, toxins, infections. There are medical tests for these kinds of problems, and in your other post you mention you have an appointment about these; that's good. In the meantime, for ongoing mold inside you, read about bile acid sequestrants such as activated charcoal. I take it. It's harsh yet works. It sucks up nutrients though, so take it a few hours away from any food or meds. What are you trying along these lines, such as detoxifiers, gut healers, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, etc.?

3. Stuff you're putting inside you. This covers things like foods with allergens such as gluten or dairy, or triggers such as artificial colors and flavors, or triggers such as oxalates or salicylates, or compounds such as histamines or histamine releasers, or chemicals in your tap water, etc. Read about these. You wrote about losing lots of weight, so aim for anything to get calories and protein into you; the safest foods are arborio rice and very fresh organic chicken that's skinned and boiled and eaten immediately. Also look at elemental shakes and nutrition shakes from Kate Farms and Neocate Splash. Many people get good results from supplements, such as diamine oxidase and/or quercetin. What are you doing for nutrition and supplements?

4. Stuff that's hurt in you and needs healing. This is where MCAS really matters because most researchers believe it's damage to the limbic system that causes disregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Stress reduction tactics can help some people a lot. Read about EMDR for trauma, SAAT for acupuncture, DNRS for limbic system reset. What are you doing and trying so far about stress reductions?

As air flows through the charcoal, the things being carried along with the air either get stuck inside the charcoal, thus filtering it out of the air and ensuring it doesn't make it to your lungs. 

not be a big, smooth block, but instead a hollow one with . That just increases the surface area and effectiveness of it. Legitimate companies, such as 3M, do a much better job at this and make a much better product than others. 

When you put a respirator on your face, it's supposed to be an air-tight fit. (If you have an ill-fitting respirator or if you have a lot of facial hair, for example, then it's not air-tight.) A good respirator will have the charcoal filters covered by a "pre-filter". If it's on correctly, then everything you breathe should be going through the pre-filter (filtering out that "dust"), then through the charcoal (filtering out gases). This is the next-best thing to simply not breathing any of it at all, aka: venting all the gases outside... which some people can't do because of their environment and setup, which I understand. 

 Honeywell but you want the "organic vapor" cartridges 

Which color cartridge mask to use against in organic gases and vapors? The cartridge has been assigned the color code “Yellow” in the NIOSH system. Breathing organic vapors or acid gases can pose a risk to your health.

FFP stands for “Filtering Facepiece”. The number 1 to 3 describes the protection level of the respiratory mask. The higher the number, the more efficiently the mask filters particles such as dust or airborne liquid particles from the air.

How long does a 3M FFP3 mask last?
How long can FFP3 masks be worn for? FFP3 masks are tested to ensure they remain effective. Provided the seal remains intact, they can be worn comfortably for at least two hours but are effective for longer unless compromised, e.g. splashed with body fluids, damp with respiration.


FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3 masks protect from fine airborne pollutants such as dust and aerosols or - in the case of FFP3 masks – also viruses. These masks are made of high-quality filter material and fit closely to the face in order to achieve the high filter performance necessary. Certified FFP masks are considered personal protective equipment (PPE) and meet the requirements of the European Standard for FFP’s EN 149. Masks without an exhalation valve can also prevent the wearer from spreading exhaled droplets and saliva. Some FFP masks without a valve are therefore additionally tested and approved as medical products according to EN 14683.

Surgical masks primarily prevent the wearer from spreading droplets and saliva when exhaling. The masks themselves offer protection against liquid splashes such as blood, but not from fine aerosols. The medical products, also known as surgical masks, are tested and approved according to EN 14683.


The European safety standard EN 149 provides for two types of FFP respirators:

    FFP masks labelled "NR" (non reusable) are intended for single use for an 8-hour shift.
    FFP masks labelled "R" (reusable) can be reused. They have a sealing lip that can be cleaned and disinfected.

    Regarding keywords to search for, look for ‘nuisance’ odour/vapour respirators. These tend to be R95 or above, and they’re probably the best bet for your situation. I hope this helps!


    VOCs, because they are gases, are about 1000 times smaller than what HEPA filters can capture. Additionally, VOCs do not stick to HEPA filters, so they are unable to deal with any that might be present in the air. Instead, look for additional technology like carbon or PECO that is partnered with the HEPA filter.


    Investigations into volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from polymer fleeces used in particle filtering half masks were conducted and evaluated against the German hygienic guide value for total volatile organic compounds and the “Lowest Concentration of Interest” for construction products. All masks showed emission of Xylene. In 94 % of samples, up to 24 additional aromatic compounds were found. 17 % of samples showed terpenes, 53 % emitted aldehydes, 77 % exhibited caprolactam and 98 % released siloxanes. All masks exceeded the TVOC hygienic guidance value level 5 of 10 mg/m³. Emission levels were investigated for masks immediately after their packages were opened and for masks that were “vented” for two weeks. Further, the emissions were repeatedly measured to investigate the decrease of emissions. An exponential decline was observed and a fitting function was calculated. The influence of the two commonly gas chromatograph (GC) hyphenated detectors, mass spectrometer (MS) and flame ionization detector (FID) on the VOC quantification, as well as the influence of temperature on the emission of VOCs were investigated.

In an allergic reaction, there is an identifiable antigen. 

- The body's immune system recorgnizes the antigen, and binds it with an antibody called immunoglobin E (IgE). 

- The result is called an "antibody-antigen complex", and it triggers receptors on mast cells and basophils. 

- This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals into the body, and generates the hypersensitivity response. 

Signs, symptoms, and responses are stereotyped based on the location of the reaction.

- If the reaction is localized, then it is stereotyped an allergic reaction.

- If the reaction is systemic, then it is stereotyped as anaphylaxis. 

In contrast, an anaphylactoid reaction occurs in the absence of an antibody-antigen complex. 

- An anaphylactoid reaction does generate mast cell (or basophil) degranulation.

- And does have many of the same signs, symptoms, and responses, as anaphylaxis.

Many adverse reactions to drugs, or drug hypersensitivies, are actually anaphylactoid reactions and not true allergies. 


The preponderance of evidence indicates that aerobic or endurance exercise produces a degranulation of mast cells and release of histamine within the exercising skeletal muscle tissue, and there does not appear to be an exercise antigen. Thus, exercise satisfies the criteria for being a localized anaphylactoid reaction within the exercised skeletal muscle tissue, rather than an allergic reaction.

Hi! Austin air is top of the line for what you need it for. They are very pricey but worth it. Under normal conditions you should only have to replace the filter every 5 years. If you need to replace it sooner they give you a huge discount(I replace mine often bc I live in an apartment building). You also qualify for a scratch and dent filter yearly. Just pay shipping. The scratch and dent ones are ones that were returned for whatever reason but are brand new. If you receive it and it doesn’t work or something is wrong with it they will send you a new one. You can also find discounts online for Austin. I emailed the company and straight up asked them for a discount and told them I just can’t afford full price and provided my medical conditions and they gave me a discount. It’s a very very good company. They have also done studies on them at John Hopkins and are also medical grade purifiers. I’ll always stand by them. They do have a quiz on their website to determine what kind you need. They have also done so much for the community. This isn’t sponsored but it sounds like it is at this point LOL another good one would be an air doctor. Anything besides those two will not really help with what WE need them for.

Dual (true) HEPA filters, a carbon filter that isn't a "sock" material, and then a first stage pre-filter. I like Honeywell, though not the price. Their customer service is quite fantastic, their warranty is lengthy and covers a great deal (not filters), and their air purifier filter systems are robust to say the least. You can also get some with an advanced filter or add-on if there's a lot of smoke or scents in the home that need to be captured that aren't quite being caught with regular filtration.
The InSight models like HPA5300B have an outer filter foamy kinda deal to catch large particles like hair, dust bunnies, etc, an activated carbon pre-filter, and typically a dual setup HEPA filter behind that. I also like the display panel they have. I can read mine quite easily even during the day when it's bright or darken it when it's night time and it displays green - yellow - red based on VOCs / corresponding air quality.

I do, but mine is mild. I eat all of the "normal" stuff within my very restrictive diet haha. A speech pathologist gave me some advice during my barium swallow test. She said when you have dysphagia, food moves more slowly down the esophagus, so you have to coax it down by chewing slowly and thoroughly. You should be drinking water throughout eating your entire meal to help it go down. She said to take your time and that it should be taking you 20 - 25 mins to finish a meal, not 10 or less (guilty as charged). And she also suggested if you have to take pills that you take only 3 - 5 total with water and then you have to have something more dense to get them down and lubricate your esophagus. It should be something pureed like applesauce, mashed potatoes, yogurt, etc. She also said it's important you sit up very straight and don't lay down for at least an hour after eating. I'm not sure if any of this will help you or not, but I wanted to pass it along in case it does.

Severe dehydration can cause a decrease in blood volume which results in a decrease in blood pressure. When blood volume is decreased, the heart has to beat faster to try to continue to deliver oxygen to your organs. 

The medical term for a heart rate over 100 beats a minute is tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh). 

The medical term for a heartbeat problem such as a skipped beat, extra beat, or irregular beat, as a heart palpitation.

If you are experiencing tachycardia or heart palpitations, then you should stop what you are doing, rest in a cool location, and drink some water. Wait until your heart resumes a normal rhythm.

For many people, mild dehydration can be easily recovered from at home with rest in a cool place and increasing fluids and electrolytes. Sports drinks and over-the-counter oral rehydration solutions, like Pedialyte, can help return the body back to its necessary fluid and electrolyte levels. More severe cases of dehydration need to be treated by emergency personnel in a hospital setting with intravenous (IV) fluid.


Symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance may include agitation, dry mouth, thirst, restlessness, confusion, cognition difficulties, muscle weakness, muscle spasms, numbness, tingling, fatigue, heart palpitations.

(Sources: Reid Health, Healthline)

An electrolyte panel is a blood test that measures the levels of seven electrolytes in your blood. Certain conditions, including dehydration, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, can cause electrolyte levels to become too high or low, which is is an electrolyte imbalance.

An electrolyte panel checks the levels of multiple minerals in your blood. Sodium controls fluid levels and aids nerve and muscle function. Potassium supports heart, nerve and muscle function, as well as metabolism. Calcium supports your musculoskeletal system (bones and muscles), nervous system and circulatory system. Chloride helps maintain healthy blood pressure and body fluid levels. Magnesium aids nerve and muscle function and promotes the growth of bones and teeth (skeletal system). Phosphate develops healthy teeth and bones and aids nerve and muscle function. Bicarbonate maintains a healthy balance of acids and basic alkaline compounds in blood (acid-base balance), and also moves carbon dioxide through your bloodstream.

Couple things.
- I suggest not using adrenaline and epinephrine interchangeably as many don’t know they’re the same thing, unless you premise with this info
- “Epi and epi fast”. Don’t wait for full-blown anaphylaxis. By then it could be too late.
- Don’t assume because you had a mild reaction to something that it will always be mild. It could actually be the thing that triggers a full-blown reaction next exposure.
- Always call 911. You need to go the ED for observation/treatment. Don’t assume one or two shots of epi will resolve it all. You may need more epi, and/or steroids, and/or other treatments.
- List your allergens with your pharmacist to ensure you’re not receiving an Rx that contains something you’re allergic to. (Think Symbicort v. Advair/Wixela; if you have a dairy allergy, the last thing you need is Advair as it contains dairy).
- Carry a clearly marked medication pack with all your meds, like epi/Albuterol/antihistamine being a protocol for some, and in that pack clearly printed instructions on how to treat you (action plan from your MD, or create your own if MD doesn’t do this for you) - always will “call 911” - and your list of emergency contacts.

When a provider uses a term like "root cause", ask their opinion of root cause analysis with CAST.

- Good looks like them knowing CAST and using it for you. CAST is Causal Analysis based on System Theory, and it is what professional use for multiple root causes that interact with each other and the holistic system. CAST is a very strong tool for MCAS.

- Bad looks like: "I've never used CAST" or the oversimplification "one root cause can cause many symptoms, or many root causes can cause one condition". 

When a provider uses a term like "all the best tests", ask which allergy tests they use often.

- Good looks like: starting with ISAC molecular blood testing and staying on your meds.

- Bad looks like: starting with any test that would need you to go off your meds.

When a provider uses the term "functional medicine", ask their opinion of traditional medicine.

- Good looks like: favoring trying traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture and SAAT, traditional Egyptian medicine such as khellin and cromolyn, traditional Inuit medicine such fish oil and omega-3, etc.

- Bad looks like: anything that talks down at traditional medicine, rather than trying it to help you get better.

When a provider uses a term like "detailed intake" or "full history", ask them to put in writing that your data is solely for the provider's eyes only for one-on-one treament, and never for the provider's vendors for advertising, marketing, promotion, aggregation, or anonomization.

- Good looks like: the provider puts it in writing. It's fine if the provider can clarify that your data needs to go to/from your other direct providers and your direct insurance company for claims; this is fine. If your provider is in the U.S. and uses Epic, that's a fine choice.

- Bad looks like: any hemming and hawing; any requests to have you sign disclosures or consent forms or advertising/marketing/promotion permissions; anything that has you sign up for a web portal that has any agreement that shows you terms and conditions to sign that says "advertising" or "marketing" or "promotion" or "aggregation" or "anonymization". If your provider uses SimplePractice or Elevate Health then veto.

Courtney Davis if they did a chest x-ray then yes it would show up as mine did. But they also confirmed it with the CT scan. My bloodwork came back, and they said that my blood was thick. There are many risk factors such as smoking, birth control, long car rides or long flights, hereditary, so if you knew anybody in your family that had a stroke or heart attack.
I don’t want to you, but it’s good to get all the bases covered. I do have CPTSD from a trauma and so I will take a sedative if my anxiety gets too high because I’m no longer on oestrogen birth control and I had genetic testing that was negative since my mom had clotted multiple times

Then today I got sick of doing plain chicken over and over so I tried it in a cassava wrap for first time with a little lettuce and plant based ranch then within like 45 mins had the chest pain

Yeah, 120/80 is generally the optimal blood pressure. And heart rate around 80 bpm but it all depends on your activity status to like high exercise 3 to 4 times a week and my resting heart rate is in the 70s and my blood pressure last time was like 111/70 something . When I was admitted, I did have elevated numbers. There is also a correlation with anxiety and perimenopause. So I’m not sure if you’re at the age yet, but a lot of women are saying that they have these random anxiety attacks and you can start perimenopause in your 30s.

Sofija Reston I do have PMDD & I’m 26 , had my son at 21 and had PMDD since; and idk if mold or a virus triggered a histamine intolerance for me but my saliva analysis said mold, Lyme, heavy metals, and EBV and my body just struggling cause it’s too much. Oh and parasites of course xD uggghhh lol. But that’s how I came to learn abt all this. So I’m doing all I can for now , but my liver results didn’t look the best my dr said it’s just struggling to detox and I need to try Chinese skullcap , whatever that is 😅 it’s so overwhelming. I just want to enjoy life again I don’t want to let this overtake me. I don’t handle stress well 💀

Courtney Davis oh yeah, it totally sucks. I started with rashes and all these other symptoms back in 2020. And I don’t know if it was caused by the chemicals I was exposed to at work because I worked in a clothing store and we were receive clothes from all over the world and they’re sprayed with chemicals and of course we weren’t wearing masks then. or I could’ve been from a virus. I am pretty sure my old house has mould in it because the basement has that musty smell. I did get allergy testing done and I’m allergic to ragweed citric acid, unconfirmed latex and unconfirmed nickel. So I’ve had to cut out so many foods, but since I’ve done that the hives have gone. I can cut out wheat and oats and chocolate about two months ago and I’ve lost 10 pounds but I still have some swelling in my face and neck. But again the hives have gone and I only used of sensitive bar soap to wash with and even used to wash my hair with. I am carnivore diet, which has been pretty easy to follow although I still have corn and once in a while, brussels sprouts or rice

Courtney Davis where is the pain located? Is it like on the right side or the left side underneath the rib? It could be your liver that’s causing the pain. there is also a tendon that can get pulled in the chest area and I forget what it’s called but it can make you feel like you’re having a heart attack

Courtney Davis yeah, I get a lump in my neck when I eat some thing that I react to. I made bacon the other day and it was fine, I can only eat egg whites the yolks seem to bother me, but I add cheese to it. I did find a recipe for rice bread that I’m going to try to make because even gluten-free bread has potato starch or tapioca starch and that’s connected to latex. I was so happy when I found rice and quinoa pasta I had a bowl of it, and then I started itching, because quinoa is connected to wheat.
Again prior to 2020 I did not have these food sensitivities. The only thing I was allergic to was tomatoes and I could eat them. I didn’t get any rashes I would occasionally get heartburn so I hear you when you are frustrated.

Sofija Reston omg thanks for that info, how do you find out what foods are connected to latex.?? It’s possible I have a latex allergy.

Courtney Davis the cross reactive protein found in certain foods like bananas, avocados, coconut, peaches, kiwi, strawberry, cherries, wheat, dandelion. There are certain sites that have more of a list and you basically just have to try thing and then see if you get a reaction from it. If I eat bananas, I will get a sore tongue and if I eat avocados I get a pounding headache in the back of my head. The wheat was causing me to have belly bloat and I would get diarrhea.
And the sad thing is, is that allergies can develop at any time, so you may have not had anything and then some stressed your body out and you developed allergies. Like citric acid is in so many pops and foods and shampoos. It’s actually made from a mold That I’m allergic to and if I have it, it makes my eyelid twitch or my muscle in my leg twitch. It’s so weird. so maybe have a food diary and try to see what your reacting to. I can’t drink out of those stainless steel tumblers because they have a nickel content and that will aggravate my eczema on my fingers.

It was after I ate & I just had the deepest pain in my chest I hate waiting for it to pass. & then it happened yesterday when I took new vitamins . Ughhh it’s so hard knowing what’s real and what’s not and the last thing you want to do is going to the ER for them to keep talking to u like ur just anxious

Yes, main cause in the beginning that constantly sent me to the ER. I carry an at home portable EKG with me now to ease my mind & anxiety when it happens. Pepcid helps relieve it.

For me it’s just a deep aching pain idek how to explain it ! Maybe a tightening feeling it just fkn HURTS 😅

Yes, it can change for me. Sometimes it's deep aching, almost like gas build up. Heavy, burning sometimes. Pressure. Sharpness can come & go too. In the beginning it felt like an elephant sitting on my chest.

Yes my 13 year old daughter during the start of an episode (rash, itching, breathing trouble) her pulse rate changes - has gone down to 40s (dizzy and nauseous and lightheaded) and up to 160. When it’s 120-160 her chest hurts for several hours after that.

Yes it does suck! I actually went to the hospital once thinking i was having a heart attack! Nope. Had the stress test. Nothing wrong. Just my mast cells causing the heart to go wonky.

Safe foods..?

Blueberries. Meats. Oats. Pear. Coffee in moderation. Beef protein powder. Chia seeds.

Water, certain chicken brands, fresh turkey, sweet potatoes, gala apples, rice, carrots and 

Organic baby food pouches- sweet potato and apple or apple sauce pouches, I keep these and rice packets from Aldi so no additives, in the car too . Gas stations have microwaves . Drinks I make ginger tea and nestle water doesn’t bother me

Beef, bone broth, cooked kale, salt, coke zero.

To eat: anything my made good foods (top 8 friendly brand).

To drink: Polar seltzer or kids liquid IV.

Water, browned ground beef, green beans, chia seeds.

My son only drinks water, whole food not from concentrate grape and apple juice, he eats chicken, pork, some fish if he is willing, turkey burger, sometimes ground beef, no meats with additives ect.. vegies not much these days and limited fruits as well. No citrus fruits forsure

Water. Blueberries, cucumbers, carrots, sweet potatoes, organic oat/puffed rice granola cereal with cashew milk, cottage cheese. If I get up early enough, I drink my mushroom coffee, but I’m going to have to give up the caffeine. This flare is causing the worst heartburn, so anything acidic has to go.
We did go to a Mexican restaurant over the weekend and had chicken tacos w arugula and fermented onion salad and split a guava beer. I was prepared for the worst, but I had only a mild headache later in the evening. I think it was okay because everything was fresh. But I eat so little now that I was stuffed. Just one taco next time.

Omalizumab (brand Xolair) inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface bound IgE on FcεRI-bearing cells limits the degree of release of mediators of the allergic response. 

 leukotriene inhibitors

 azithromycin, prednisone, nystatin for a sinus infection and PANS/PANDAS

You need to be checked for HATS and if that’s negative check for the KIT gene mutation or both tests at the same time ideally. That will point you in the direction of either you have HATS causing the high tryptase or if your kit gene mutation comes back positive, you need to start working with a hematologic oncologist on testing for systemic mastocytosis/MCAS. This will be a process there’s no quick answer on this. Just take it step by step.

When hives pop up, you can try a non-drowsy oral antihistamine like cetirizine, fexofenadine, or loratadine. At night, you might use a sedating antihistamine like cyproheptadine, diphenhydramine, doxepin, or hydroxyzine.

I have a severe adhesive allergy (blisters, chemical burns, permanent scarring) and have a central line (tunneled catheter) that's had to have medical adhesive dressings on it 24/7 for the last 3 years. For the sake of my fingers I don't want to type it all out but if you can't watch the video, just let me know and I will do so. To summarize, my 3 tips included: the names of several hypoallergenic, special adhesive products you can order, but in the case of heart monitors, either ask for pediatric heart monitor stickies if they have them (not everywhere does) or any they offer for sensitive skin, or follow suggestions #2 and #3 which were to use barrier products (SkinPrep, Cavilon Barrier Cream, etc) and to pre-treat with cromolyn sodium and/or benadryl and/or flonase. Or ideally a combination, as each are separate - cromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabilizer, benadryl is an antihistamine, and flonase is a steroid which is a potent antiinflammatory and mast cell stabilizer, be sure to use the liquid forms not the creams which will make the pads not stick properly and not register signals properly, apply them on the skin first and let it air dry before putting on the adhesive pads. Additionally, I recommend asking for copious extra pads so that you can change them out more frequently if needed to reapply benadryl and handle skin reactions. Hope some of this helps and let me know if you can't watch the video.

 Here is a list of the MCAS symptoms that are most commonly seen in the patients within the practices of Drs. Lawrence Afrin and Tania Dempsey. (Both have treated hundreds of MCAS patients and are experts in this area.) They have organized the list by organ system to enable this initial step.
Not a bad idea to print it out and highlight whatever applies. MCAS is notorious for producing symptom patterns that change over time, so be sure to include any applicable symptoms that appeared in the past but have since resolved.
https://www.drtaniadempsey.com/.../clinical...
For additional information on MCAS, you'll find that most any article or interview on the subject by either of the above two doctors can be helpful. (Trying to educate yourself using random search engine results tends to backfire because there is a considerable amount of misinformation out there. If you first explore what's available from Drs. Afrin and Dempsey you'll gradually learn to recognize the difference.)
Here is an introductory overview that Dr. A wrote that can be helpful for new patients and their families:
https://www.drtaniadempsey.com/.../mast-cell-activation...
In this interview conducted by the journalist Aaron Goodman, Dr. A delves more into several aspects of MCAS that are mentioned in the above article:

 There is an enzyme, Diamine Oxidase (DAO), that breaks down histamines in the body that some humans genetically make little to none of. Yes, there is supplementation for it, but many forget most humans have been designed to make it themselves. This is only one root cause for histamine intolerance, and there are many root causes.
Add that Mast cells can explode and give us an overabundance of histamines that cannot be processed fast enough.
There is also a term called histaminosis, which is a very true, and I have personally dealt with it.
These concepts are usually enough for me to teach said non-believers about the truth of histamines.
The education system is significantly behind, and these groups of like afflicted people are far ahead on the newest data on their conditions; we are the awareness spreaders, and we are part of the latest education.

No sugar, all processed foods, gluten and dairy. Sugar was the hardest. I craved it so bad for a week. But after a week I didn’t crave it and 

Sweet potatoes tasted like dessert with just butter and salt.
I have a few safe foods that I have no reaction to and I’m introducing more one at a time.

**Safe foods:**

* Gluten-Free Oatmeal.

* Egg yolks. Ideally organic and free-range.

* Boiled Chicken. No artificial hormones. Ideally organic and free-range.

* Boiled Salmon. No artificial hormones. Ideally wild-caught, either same-day or flash-frozen.

* Basmati Rice and Jasmine Rice. Ideally organic and GMO-free.

oxalate
ChatGPT

Oxalate, or oxalic acid, is a naturally occurring compound found in many plants and in the human body. It is an organic acid that is present in various foods and is also produced as a metabolic byproduct. Oxalate plays a role in several physiological processes but is primarily known for its association with kidney stones and certain dietary considerations. Here are some key points about oxalate:

    Dietary Sources: Oxalate is found in a wide range of foods, including leafy greens (such as spinach and Swiss chard), beets, nuts, seeds, chocolate, and certain fruits and vegetables. It can also be found in tea and coffee. The levels of oxalate in foods can vary, with some items having significantly higher concentrations than others.

    Kidney Stones: Oxalate is a key component of many kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate stones. When there is an excess of oxalate in the urine, it can combine with calcium to form crystals, which can lead to the development of kidney stones. People who are prone to kidney stones are often advised to limit their dietary oxalate intake.

    Oxalate Metabolism: The human body can both produce oxalate and obtain it from dietary sources. The metabolism of oxalate is complex, and various factors can influence how the body handles it, including genetics and the presence of certain bacteria in the gut.

    Health Implications: While oxalate is generally not harmful to most people and is a part of many healthy foods, high levels of dietary oxalate may be problematic for those at risk of developing kidney stones. Certain medical conditions, such as hyperoxaluria, can lead to elevated levels of oxalate in the urine, increasing the risk of stone formation.

    Cooking and Preparation: Cooking and other food preparation methods can affect the oxalate content of foods. Boiling vegetables can reduce their oxalate content as it leaches into the cooking water. However, some oxalate remains in the food, so complete elimination is not possible.

    Individual Variation: People vary in their sensitivity to dietary oxalate. Some individuals may be more susceptible to kidney stone formation, while others can consume high-oxalate foods without issue. It's important for those with a history of kidney stones or other concerns related to oxalate to work with healthcare providers and dietitians to manage their dietary choices.

In summary, oxalate is a natural compound found in various foods and is involved in the formation of kidney stones in some individuals. While dietary oxalate is not a concern for most people, those at risk of kidney stones should be mindful of their oxalate intake and consult with healthcare professionals for guidance on managing their diet.

oxalate and mast cells
ChatGPT

Oxalate is a natural compound found in various foods, as mentioned in the previous response, and it has the potential to interact with mast cells in the body. Mast cells are a type of immune cell that plays a role in allergic reactions and inflammation. When mast cells are activated, they can release various substances, including histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which can lead to allergy symptoms and other immune responses.

In some individuals, dietary oxalate intake can lead to mast cell activation and the release of histamine, resulting in symptoms such as hives, itching, flushing, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances. This is more likely to occur in people who have a condition called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) or other mast cell disorders, where mast cells are overly sensitive and easily triggered by various stimuli, including dietary factors.

It's important to note that not everyone with a mast cell disorder will react to dietary oxalate, and the extent of the reaction can vary from person to person. Some individuals may need to limit their oxalate intake to manage their symptoms, while others may not experience significant issues with oxalate-rich foods.

People with mast cell disorders often work closely with healthcare providers, such as allergists and immunologists, to develop individualized dietary plans and treatment strategies to manage their condition. These plans may include avoiding or limiting foods high in oxalate or other potential triggers, as well as the use of medications to control mast cell activation and its associated symptoms.

If you suspect that dietary oxalate is affecting your mast cell disorder or experiencing symptoms that may be related to mast cell activation, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who specializes in these conditions. They can provide guidance and perform necessary evaluations to help you manage your specific situation.

eosinophil
ChatGPT

Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell, specifically a type of granulocyte, that plays a role in the immune system and is involved in the body's response to various infections, allergens, and certain inflammatory conditions. Eosinophils are characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm, which contain substances that are released during their activation.

Here are some key points about eosinophils:

    Function: Eosinophils play a role in the immune response against parasites, particularly helminths (worm-like parasites). They are also involved in the allergic response, such as in allergic rhinitis, asthma, and eczema. Eosinophils are attracted to sites of inflammation and infection and contribute to the immune response by releasing chemical mediators, such as histamines, leukotrienes, and cytokines.

    Regulation of Inflammation: Eosinophils help regulate the body's inflammatory responses. While they are typically associated with allergies and asthma, they can also be found in other inflammatory conditions, such as eosinophilic esophagitis and some autoimmune diseases.

    Normal Levels: Eosinophils are present in the bloodstream, but their numbers are relatively low under normal conditions. The typical range for eosinophils in a complete blood count (CBC) is around 0 to 500 cells per microliter of blood.

    High Eosinophil Count: An increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood, known as eosinophilia, can be a sign of various medical conditions. These may include allergies, parasitic infections, asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and some types of leukemia or other blood disorders.

    Diagnostic Value: Measuring eosinophil levels through a blood test can be valuable for diagnosing and monitoring certain diseases and conditions. High eosinophil levels might indicate the need for further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

    Treatment: Management of elevated eosinophil counts often depends on the underlying condition. For allergic reactions, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and other medications may be used to reduce eosinophil activation and the associated symptoms.

    Mast Cells: Eosinophils are sometimes associated with mast cells, another type of immune cell that releases histamines and other substances during allergic responses and inflammatory reactions. Both eosinophils and mast cells can contribute to the symptoms of allergic diseases.

Eosinophils are a critical component of the immune system and help the body fight off infections and respond to various stimuli. Elevated eosinophil levels can indicate an underlying health issue and may require further investigation by a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate treatment and management.

central sensitisation syndrome
ChatGPT

Central Sensitization Syndrome (CSS) is a term used to describe a condition in which the central nervous system becomes hypersensitive, leading to an amplified and prolonged perception of pain and other sensory stimuli. It is a neurological phenomenon that is thought to underlie the development and maintenance of chronic pain conditions and other symptoms.

Key points about Central Sensitization Syndrome (CSS) include:

    Mechanism: CSS is characterized by changes in the way the central nervous system processes sensory input, particularly pain signals. It results from increased responsiveness of neurons in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) to various stimuli. This heightened sensitivity can lead to the experience of pain even in response to non-painful or mildly painful stimuli.

    Common Symptoms: CSS is often associated with chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (myalgic encephalomyelitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and certain types of headaches. Patients with CSS may also experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties (sometimes referred to as "fibro fog"), and emotional symptoms like anxiety and depression.

    Diagnosis: Diagnosing CSS can be challenging because it is a complex and multifaceted condition. Healthcare providers often rely on clinical evaluation, patient-reported symptoms, and the exclusion of other underlying medical conditions to make a diagnosis. There are no specific tests or imaging studies to confirm CSS.

    Triggers: CSS can be triggered or exacerbated by various factors, including physical trauma, surgery, infections, psychological stress, and genetic predisposition.

    Treatment: The management of CSS often involves a multimodal approach. This may include medications to address pain and associated symptoms, physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle modifications. Reducing stress and improving sleep quality can be particularly important in managing CSS.

    Education: Patients with CSS can benefit from education about their condition to better understand the mechanisms behind their symptoms. Knowing that the pain and sensitivities are related to central nervous system changes can be empowering and help patients participate in their treatment and self-care.

    Prognosis: CSS is considered a chronic condition, and management focuses on symptom relief and improving the patient's quality of life. While CSS symptoms can be persistent, many individuals experience improvements with appropriate care and lifestyle adjustments.

It's important for individuals experiencing chronic pain or other symptoms associated with CSS to seek evaluation and treatment from healthcare providers, including pain specialists, neurologists, or rheumatologists. A comprehensive approach to managing CSS often includes both medical and non-medical interventions to address the physical, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the condition.

Prolotherapy
ChatGPT

Prolotherapy, short for "proliferative therapy," is a medical treatment used to stimulate the body's natural healing processes and promote tissue repair in cases of chronic musculoskeletal pain and certain joint-related conditions. It is also known as regenerative injection therapy. Prolotherapy involves the injection of an irritant solution into damaged or weakened ligaments, tendons, or joints to initiate a localized inflammatory response, leading to tissue repair and strengthening.

Key points about prolotherapy include:

    Mechanism: Prolotherapy works on the principle that introducing a mildly irritating substance, often a dextrose (sugar water) solution, into an injured or weakened area can stimulate inflammation and healing. The inflammatory response is thought to trigger the body's natural repair mechanisms, leading to the production of new collagen and tissue strengthening.

    Conditions Treated: Prolotherapy is typically used for conditions such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, tendinitis, ligament sprains, and joint instability. It may be considered when conventional treatments, like physical therapy or pain medications, have not provided sufficient relief.

    Procedure: During a prolotherapy session, a healthcare provider injects the solution directly into the affected ligaments, tendons, or joint spaces. The number of sessions required depends on the condition and the individual's response to treatment. Multiple sessions are usually needed to achieve the desired results.

    Safety: Prolotherapy is generally considered safe when administered by trained healthcare professionals. Potential side effects may include temporary pain, swelling, or stiffness at the injection site. Serious complications are rare but can occur.

    Efficacy: The effectiveness of prolotherapy is a subject of ongoing research and debate. Some studies suggest that it may provide pain relief and functional improvement in certain cases, while others question its long-term benefits.

    Patient Selection: Prolotherapy is not suitable for everyone, and its use should be determined on a case-by-case basis. A healthcare provider will assess whether the individual is a suitable candidate based on their specific condition and medical history.

    Complementary or Alternative Treatment: Prolotherapy is considered a complementary or alternative therapy and may be used in conjunction with other treatments for musculoskeletal pain. Patients are often advised to consider lifestyle modifications, exercise, and physical therapy in addition to prolotherapy.

It's essential for individuals considering prolotherapy to have a thorough discussion with a qualified healthcare provider who can evaluate their specific condition and discuss the potential benefits, risks, and alternatives. While some patients report significant pain relief and improved function with prolotherapy, its effectiveness can vary, and the decision to pursue this treatment should be based on an informed and individualized assessment.

cognitive behavioral therapy
ChatGPT

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely practiced and evidence-based form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping individuals identify and change patterns of thinking and behavior that contribute to their psychological distress, emotional difficulties, and maladaptive behaviors. CBT is based on the premise that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and changing negative thought patterns can lead to improved emotional well-being and more constructive actions.

Key points about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) include:

    Core Principles: CBT is rooted in several core principles, including the idea that our thoughts influence our emotions and behaviors, and that by recognizing and challenging unhelpful thought patterns, individuals can learn to manage and cope with their psychological issues more effectively.

    Collaborative Approach: CBT is often delivered in a collaborative therapeutic relationship between the therapist and the client. The therapist helps the client identify and understand their thought patterns and behaviors and assists in developing new, healthier cognitive and behavioral strategies.

    Identifying Cognitive Distortions: CBT helps individuals recognize and challenge cognitive distortions, which are irrational or negative thinking patterns. These distortions can include catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, and overgeneralization, among others.

    Goal-Oriented: CBT is typically a goal-oriented therapy. Clients work with their therapist to establish specific, achievable goals and learn skills and strategies to achieve those goals.

    Time-Limited: CBT is often considered a time-limited therapy, meaning it is focused on achieving specific goals in a relatively short period, typically 12-16 weeks. However, the number of sessions may vary depending on individual needs and the nature of the issues being addressed.

    Versatile: CBT is used to treat a wide range of psychological and emotional issues, including depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, and substance use disorders, among others.

    Evidence-Based: CBT is well-supported by scientific research and is considered one of the most effective psychotherapeutic approaches for various mental health conditions. It has been extensively studied and validated through clinical trials.

    Self-Help and Homework: Clients in CBT often engage in homework assignments and practice exercises outside of therapy sessions to reinforce the skills they learn during treatment.

    Adaptations: CBT has been adapted and modified for different populations and settings, including children and adolescents, couples, and group therapy.

    Combining with Medication: In some cases, CBT may be used in conjunction with medication, particularly in the treatment of conditions like depression or anxiety disorders. This combination approach is known as "CBT combined with pharmacotherapy."

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a highly structured and practical approach to addressing psychological difficulties. It equips individuals with the tools and strategies they need to challenge and change negative thought patterns and behaviors, leading to improved emotional well-being and better coping skills. If you are considering CBT, it's important to seek a qualified mental health professional who is trained in this therapeutic approach.

Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) 
ChatGPT

Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a complex and controversial medical condition characterized by a heightened inflammatory response to environmental triggers, such as mold, certain toxins, and other biotoxins. CIRS is most often associated with exposure to water-damaged buildings or environments contaminated with mold, and it is believed to result from a genetic predisposition that leads to an abnormal immune response to these environmental factors.

Key points about Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) include:

    Environmental Triggers: CIRS typically occurs in individuals who have been exposed to specific environmental triggers, such as mycotoxins produced by molds like Stachybotrys chartarum. Other potential triggers include bacteria, endotoxins, and volatile organic compounds from water-damaged buildings.

    Symptoms: CIRS is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that can vary from person to person but often include fatigue, cognitive difficulties (often referred to as "brain fog"), respiratory issues, musculoskeletal pain, headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and mood disturbances.

    Mechanism: It is thought that individuals with CIRS have a genetic predisposition that leads to an abnormal immune response when exposed to certain biotoxins. This immune dysregulation can lead to chronic inflammation and the range of associated symptoms.

    Diagnosis: The diagnosis of CIRS can be challenging, as there is no specific laboratory test that can definitively confirm the condition. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, patient history, and the presence of specific symptoms in response to biotoxin exposure. Some practitioners use the Shoemaker protocol, which includes a panel of blood tests, to aid in diagnosis.

    Controversy: CIRS is a subject of controversy within the medical community. While some healthcare providers and patients advocate for its recognition and treatment, others argue that the condition is not well-defined, and there is insufficient scientific evidence to support it as a distinct medical entity.

    Treatment: Treatment for CIRS often involves removing the individual from the environment with biotoxin exposure, addressing any mold or biotoxin sources, and symptom management. Therapies may include antifungal medications, binders to help remove toxins, and lifestyle modifications. Some individuals also receive immune modulators or anti-inflammatory treatments.

    Individual Variation: CIRS can manifest differently from person to person, and not all individuals exposed to biotoxins will develop this syndrome. Genetic factors and the nature and duration of exposure play a role in who is affected.

It's important to note that the diagnosis and management of CIRS can be complex and are not universally accepted within the medical community. Individuals who believe they may have CIRS should consult with healthcare providers who are experienced in evaluating and treating environmental illness and related conditions. Healthcare professionals should consider a comprehensive approach to address both environmental triggers and the management of symptoms, working closely with their patients.

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
ChatGPT

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is a medical condition characterized by a systemic, widespread inflammatory response in the body. It is a response to various forms of severe insults or injuries, such as infections, trauma, burns, major surgeries, or other critical illnesses. SIRS is not a disease itself but rather a clinical syndrome with specific criteria used to assess the body's inflammatory response.

Key points about Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) include:

    Diagnostic Criteria: SIRS is diagnosed based on the presence of specific clinical criteria, which include abnormalities in vital signs and laboratory values. The criteria include abnormalities in at least two of the following four categories:
        Abnormal body temperature: Fever (a high body temperature) or hypothermia (a low body temperature).
        Elevated heart rate (tachycardia) or a significant increase in heart rate in response to stress.
        Rapid breathing (tachypnea) or an elevated respiratory rate.
        Abnormal white blood cell count, which can manifest as an elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) or a low white blood cell count (leukopenia).

    Causes: SIRS is typically triggered by severe infections (sepsis), trauma, burns, major surgery, or other critical illnesses. In these conditions, the body's immune response becomes dysregulated, leading to excessive inflammation that can affect multiple organ systems.

    Complications: If not promptly recognized and treated, SIRS can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, which are life-threatening conditions. Organ dysfunction and failure can occur in the advanced stages of SIRS.

    Treatment: The treatment of SIRS primarily involves addressing the underlying cause. In cases of infection, antibiotics are often prescribed. Supportive care, such as maintaining adequate oxygen levels, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring of vital signs, is essential to manage SIRS.

    Prognosis: The prognosis for SIRS varies depending on the underlying condition, the timing of treatment, and the patient's overall health. Early recognition and intervention are key to improving outcomes.

    Clinical Assessment: Healthcare providers use various clinical assessments and tools to evaluate SIRS and its severity. Scoring systems like the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the quick SOFA (qSOFA) are used to determine the likelihood of severe outcomes in patients with SIRS.

    Infection and Non-Infectious Causes: While SIRS is most commonly associated with infections, it can also occur in response to non-infectious causes, such as severe trauma or burns. In these cases, the body's inflammatory response can be triggered by tissue damage.

    Research and Advances: There is ongoing research to better understand the pathophysiology of SIRS and to develop more effective treatments. Timely diagnosis and intervention continue to be the focus of efforts to improve outcomes for individuals with SIRS.

SIRS is a critical condition that requires prompt medical attention and intervention. Healthcare providers use a combination of clinical criteria, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to diagnose and manage SIRS. The primary goal of treatment is to address the underlying cause and provide supportive care to stabilize the patient's condition.

 including smoldering SM and BM mastocytosis (BMM), and updated criteria for MCAS and other condi-
tions involving MC. CD30 expression in MC now qualifies as a minor SM criterion, and BMM is now defined by SM criteria, absence
of skin lesions and absence of B- and C-findings. A basal serum tryptase level exceeding 20 ng/mL remains a minor SM criterion,
with recognition that hereditary alpha-tryptasemia and various myeloid neoplasms may also cause elevations in tryptase. Our updated
proposal will support diagnostic evaluations and prognostication in daily practice and the conduct of clinical trials in MC disorders.

I was diagnosed with hEDS (Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome). With this rare genetic disorder: 1 out of every 15 people that have hEDS, also develop Cranialcervical Instability (CCI). Those that have CCI and hEDS, unfortunately always also have MCAS. I also have POTS which is very common. I used to have Idiopathic Intercranial Hypertension, another common comorbidity, but it has since been resolved suddenly and unexpectedly.

I have systematic mastocytosis I take sodium cromolyn and mix it with water, lots of zertec (generic works too) and montelkaust to help with breathing and head pains. Try getting your doctors to do blood test, bone density test, bone marrow test, and a 48 hour urine test. After that you should know if you have a mast cell disorder. Stay strong guys we will be ok 😊

I have MCAS but not EDsyndrome...it’s taken 20 years (after having a ruptured appendix and peritonitis in ‘98) to get CLOSE to a diagnosis....thankful for my RNP who looked at my blotchy purple legs and heard my complaints of burning sensations with extreme fatigue...SHE figured out that it was MAST cell related and she put me on Montelukast, and within 2 days my never ending rash/hives (that I had been living with for months at a time) 2 days...and it disappeared completely!

Check out also for low dopamine in the brain. If you are a Highly Sensitive Person, you already have lower dopamine than others. Where there is low dopamine, there's more activation in mast cells. Treated with dopamine agonist (if you have low dopamine), antihistamines (H1, H2), vitamin D, (a small amount) injection of adrenaline under the skin of your belly. Occasional cortisone. Some also benefit from IV saline infusion, MCAS comes with dysautonomia. (You can also have EDS, if hypermobility is present)

I know there are specific criteria for diagnosing SM and MCAS. But what about Hereditary Alpha Tryptasemia as a genetic cause for MCAS? I was diagnosed with HATS earlier this year by my geneticist, in addition to my hEDS & POTS. The allergy/immunology specialist I saw told me that a lifetime’s worth (53 years) of symptoms, disability and invasive medical interventions due to anaphylaxis, immune deficiency, severe gastroparesis chronic migraine, seizures, anxiety, ADHD and chronic pain syndromes etc. don’t qualify as MCAS? My medical records are packed with blood tests, elevated tryptase levels and other objective findings to support that the extra ALPHA tryptase genes is involved.
