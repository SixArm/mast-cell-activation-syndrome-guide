Safe waters: 1. Have you tried mountain valley spring water in the green glass bottle? I know that doesn’t help you right now, but it’s my only safe water. 2. I have recently tried the sparkling water from Trader Joe’s and I think whole food sells it.  It’s a white label and I’ll go look for the name. They have still water too but I haven’t seen that option often Gerolsteiner Is the brand, in glass bottle only

neuroendocrine tumor. asked about MENS


I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying that your recent tests show elevated , and also protein in your urine, but the doctor didn't give an explanation/diagnosis and also didn't schedule a followup this week

Ken Cova: So far antihistamines haven't done much for me either, although I have yet to try some of them. I have seen a good response to a number of the supplements that target the condition: Quercitin, Luteolin, Neuroprotek by Mirica, also to aspirin.

Natalia Barzani:
I travelled from Sweden to the UK, London
I've been seeing prof Simmonds, prof Khullar and prof Birchall. 
For MCAS and EDS prof Khullar is excellent and diagnosed me. 
For EDS prof Simmonds most definitely her. 
If your sister needs PT I'd recommend Julie Griffis American PT, via Telehealth.
 I'm going to continue PT for life as it has done so much for me. Julie is excellent.

Long Covid (LC), 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), 
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), 
Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), 
Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO), and 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) are all loosely connected, 
some poorly defined, some with overlapping symptoms. 

The female preponderance, the prominence of fatigue and chronic inflammation,
and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) abnormalities may connect them
all. Indeed differential methylation may lie at the root. Two - EDS and MTHFR -
are genetic. But epigenetic factors may ultimately determine their phenotypic
expression. Oxidative stress, overloaded mitochondria, an antioxidant and
nutrient shortfall, and suboptimal gut microbiome appear to be the primary
determinants. A deep dive into [folate metabolism] and [methionine metabolism]
is undertaken in an attempt to connect these syndromes. The active forms of
vitamin D and vitamins B2,3,6,9,12 are shown to be biochemically integral to
optimal methylation and control of the epigenome. Their status largely
determines the symptoms of abnormal MTHFR in all its phenotypes. The wider
implications for aging, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative
disease, and autoimmune disease are briefly explored.

## Diagnostics


### Nose-throat scope

Do nose-throat scope testing. This can be done by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist or head-neck specialist:

- [ ] Test for acid reflux, structural abnormalities, GERD, EoS, etc.

  - Typically this can be done by using a nose-throat scope during a routine office visit.

If testing turns up acid issues:

- [ ] Rx antacid, such as famotidine (a.k.a. brand name Pepcid).

  - In addition to decreasing acid, famotidine is a histamine-2 blocker (H2 blocker).

If testing turns up structural anomalies:

- [ ] Do a head-neck CT scan with contrast.

  - This is to rule out problems such as throat cancer.


### Gut tox screen

Gut toxin screening by an internal medicine specialist or similar immunology specialist.

Aim for comprehensive testing of GI toxins:

- [ ] Test for mycotoxins in urine.

  - A comprehensive test includes 40+ items.

  - A company that offers this testing is [Mosaic DX](https://mosaicdx.com)

### Histamine symptom management

Daily medications:

- [ ] Montelukast (a.k.a. brand name Singulair) (Rx)

- [ ] Morning & evening H1 + H2 oral antihistamines (OTC)

- [ ] Morning & evening nasal sprays

Also:

- [ ] Adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) emergency auto-injector (a.k.a. brand name EpiPen)


### Anti-fungal herbal agents

[5 Herbal Agents for Antifungal Therapy](https://mosaicdx.com/resource/5-herbal-agents-for-antifungal-therapy/)

- [ ] Goldenseal a.k.a. Hydrastis canadensis

- [ ] Black Walnut a.k.a. Juglans nigra

- [ ] Echinacea a.k.a. Echinacea purpurea

- [ ] Grapefruit seed extract

- [ ] Garlic a.k.a. Allium sativum


## Allergy testing

Allergy testing a.k.a. histamine-response testing can be done by an allergy specialist or similar immunology specialist.

- [ ] Do comprehensive skin prick panels for flora, fauna, chemicals, etc.

  - This includes 400+ items.

  - This is more comprehensive and more accurate than typical allergy blood tests.

  - This is best done after a week or so without taking any antihistamines, because antihistamines tend to interfere with the skin prick testing.


## Gut cleanse

Gut bile cleaning via bile acid sequestrants.

- [ ] Cholestyramine (Rx) is a popular choice, and also helps lower cholesterol.

- [ ] Colesevelam (a.k.a. Welchol) (Rx) is a similar choice, and may be better-tolerated.

- [ ] Activated charcoal (OTC) is a similar choice, and may be stronger and faster.

Estimate 2-4 weeks to feel results.

Research now suggests an elevated plasma heparin level likely is the single most sensitive marker of MCA, with approximately 80% of patients clinically demonstrating symptoms consistent with MCA showing increased levels of plasma heparin when measured using a sufficiently sensitive assay.

primary (i.e. clonal) MCAS proven by the presently very limited range of laboratory testing routinely available for proving such [KIT-D816X mutational analysis, and flow cytometry seeking co-expression on the surfaces of MCs of CD117 (the extracellular domain of transmembrane tyrosine kinase KIT, the dominant MC regulatory element) together with CD25 (the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, dominantly expressed by T-cells) and/or CD2 (ordinarily a surface adhesion molecule restricted to T/NK-lymphocytes)], and (2) far more common patients with “idiopathic” MCAS, which preliminary research [15], [16], [17] strongly suggests is almost always driven by one (largely MC-restricted, largely somatic) mutational profile or another among a very large menagerie of such profiles in KIT and other MC regulatory elements.

* **Neurological Disorders:** Certain neurological conditions, such as neuropathies, can lead to autonomic dysfunction. For example, diabetic neuropathy can affect the autonomic nervous system in individuals with diabetes.

* **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** POTS is characterized by an abnormal increase in heart rate upon standing, leading to symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting.

* **Neurocardiogenic Syncope:** This condition involves episodes of fainting, often triggered by specific factors like stress, pain, or prolonged standing.

* **Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome):** This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system and is more common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.
