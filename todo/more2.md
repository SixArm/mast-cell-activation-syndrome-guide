Esophageal spasm squeezes your esophagus, which is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Typical symptoms are difficulty swallowing and chest pain. It may feel like a heart attack, or like you have food stuck in your throat.

Bronchospasm is a tightening of the muscles that line your bronchi, which are your airways in your lungs. Typical symptoms are feeling like it's hard to catch your breath and wheezing, as well as coughing, dizziness, and fatigue.


Game changer my fellow warriors! Do you all have the Bobby Parrish app?
Free & you won’t believe how helpful it is.
I am AIP, Gluten free, low histamine, low fodmap, low sugar, dairy, and my intolerances are way greater than what I can safely eat.
Even the shakes like Kate’s Farms and now trying OWYN. With bodies as sensitive as ours - gluten seems to be not any kind of good. Jovial pasta’s are really great. Oh no tomatoes they are a super high inflammatory food.
