# What improved your quality of life?

Xyzal and fomatadine twice a day. I haven't had a single hive or rash since I started.

Stop sodium lauryl sulfites in toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner.

Moving to a mold-free home. Moving to a dry climate.

Sauna followed by an ice-cold shower.

Circadian biology and sunlight for therapy.

**Medications:**

Xolair. Ozempic. Cromolyn sodium: I do 4 times per day, 1 teaspoon per time, and went from going to the bathroom 15 times a day to 5; do not take other meds at the same time as cromolyn; wait at least 30 minutes.
  
Ketotifen 2 times per day. 

* Gabapentin for stomach acid pain; but it has adverse effects such as increasing cholesterol, weight gain, and causing a stutter.

* Changing my antihistamine from Xyzal to Zyrtec.

* Limbic System retraining and itâ€™s helping a lot as well

**Diet:**

* **Losing weight.**

* **Cut out dairy and gluten.**

* **Keto diet. Carnivore diet.**

 low salicylic acid diet has been a life saver. It is in most spices too. I limit spices in most item I eat. Usually just salt
