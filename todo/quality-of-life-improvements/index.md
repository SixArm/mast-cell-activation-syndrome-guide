The books are done. All furniture is done unless it is completely metal and glass. This goes double for big soft things, like your couch and mattress.

Get rid of all that you can bare to part with. All of it.

For the things you must keep, they should go into storage away from where you live and sleep. So your bone collection. Unless it has extreme sentimental irreplaceable value, everything you store should be nonporous. No furniture, clothes, or books. Be real with yourself and keep what truly matters. You may never be able to reclaim what is in storage and you don‚Äôt want to be endlessly paying for storage on it.

It is going to be easier on your mental and physical health if you move out and embrace a minimalist lifestyle. Sleep on an air mattress. Start with 3 days worth of clothes and just do laundry nearly everyday. You need your health more than you need any of these things.

Some people are able to keep much more. Those people tend to not be as sick, tend to not have been in mold as long, and/or tend to not have some of the more dangerous molds. Gently but bluntly, it does not seem that you have many, if any, of those factors going for you.

Once you have healed a bit, you can start testing yourself by removing things from

For those with hypothyroidism, take a look at your full panel labs, if T3 is low despite taking T4 (synthroid), and you are struggling with hypo symptoms, you might consider adding T3 or even going to T3 mono therapy. This really moved the needle toward recovery for me, but be aware most endocrinologists don‚Äôt like to prescribe T3‚Ä¶ but there are provider lists in some thyroid groups. also know there is a relationship between low T3 and allergic responses.

We also have a xyzal / Pepcid / Benadryl / dao / bromelin / quercetin / inhaler / low histamine food regimen but those are all the supporting cast to Xolair. 

antihistamines in general shut off the center in your brain that tells you when you're full. My doc gave me an appetite suppressant to counteract it

Outgassing: Higher temperatures will outgas MUCH faster. In a brand new home I'd crank the heat to 90+, which will accomplish the equivalent of months worth of outgassing.

Electrolytes!! I use LMNT 2-3 a day. I have disautonomia and HEDS so my salt intake is supposed to be about 3x a normal person.
The first time I tried it anytime I ate beef or pork my heart rate spiked so I did salmon and chicken then slowly started to add them back in. Now I can eat them without the spikes or weird issues.

Graves‚Äô disease (hyperthyroidism). 

Use a dehumidifier. Use an oven exhaust. Use a bathroom exhaust fan.

Get an HTMA hair test and ANY mineral that is below 50% get up. If you have ratios out of balance, correct them. You‚Äôll have to retake the test every four months. Make sure your iodine, copper and Vitamin D are all mid range. Ensure ferritin (not iron) is above 50. Pay special attention to copper, iodine, molybdenum, and ferritin. Those ones are big. If you have any symptoms of estrogen problems, e.g. cysts, painful periods, etc, take calcium d glucarate 500mg to 1000mg once daily. That will help you detox excess estrogens. If you‚Äôre not getting rid of extra estrogen floating around you‚Äôre doomed to never recover. DIM is another supp you can use to help but the CDG works well. I took PURE encaps ONE vitamin every other day, Dr Bergs mineral supp on opposing days along with extra molybdenum bc I was low and food based vitamin C twice daily and iron syrup (I make it) to get my ferritin out of the gutter. Again, we are talking ferritin, not iron. You‚Äôll find over time you‚Äôre able to eat more foods and then you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre off all meds. Took me two years .

I test it all myself with HTMA and then I do my own bloodwork at ultalabs.com

Take Dr. Bergs mineral supp every other day, which has copper. You gotta know your levels bc you don‚Äôt want to overdo on minerals. For ferritin I make herbal iron syrup. Do a google search you‚Äôll find the recipe.

I'm also doing SAAT.... Which I know is controversial but it's helped. I'm very impatiently waiting for my next set of needles in 8 days. B

Get a microbiome test done through a naturopath and balance your gut. I too had 5 viruses activated in my system, severe histamine intolerance, you name it. I was the worse case they‚Äôd seen and couldn‚Äôt even medicate me, Until you can settle your system you will continue in this cycle.

I ended up on an elemental diet shake for 3 months while microdosing in saccramycces boullardi.

dehumidifiers are known to mold. Mold docs say to drain them out a window not into a tank.

moisture absorbing bags "moisture. I keep them near my windows in the rest of the apartment, and under sinks, where moisture tends to like to live.
I also wipe the shower down woth a dry microfiber cloth after a shower to reduce chances of mold growth in the bathroom itself. And I clean the bathroom with mold prevention cleaner.

if you already have hidden mold growth (most mold that is bad doesn‚Äôt really show up visibly) that using a dehumidifier and purifier will not help. 

it is really important to have vit. D and vit B12 in optimal reference. If can‚Äôt take supplements you can start collecting vit D by sun and there is vit B12 injections, if needed.

I have found that my throat swelling was mostly due to oxalates. The solution was to take calcium. There was relief within an hour. I use the Spring Valley brand from Walmart. Before then, my throat would swell a lot and it would scare me. I have not had that feeling since beginning the calcium.

Food wise I have to stay away from anything with natural flavours (alcohol in extracts) vinegar, yeast or anything fermented. They act like alcohol in our stomachs. Then anything high in nickel which all legumes are high and most food contain soy. I have the ‚Äúintolerances‚Äù app. Check out what foods have nickel and see if theres a pattern.
Atm ive been eating lots of roast chicken in tortillas, plain pasta, fried eggs.

Protein to repair the tissues. I used to only be able to consume organic pea protein powder, but have found sources for pasture raised turkey and wild caught flash frozen salmon.
When you are in a flare, you first need to be able to consume nutrition that does not further inflame your body and that will be unique to you. After you have a few days of one-2 foods, your body naturally will become nutrient deprived and hungry. Try adding protein. Whatever type you choose to add in, make it organic pasture raised l/finished or wild caught and not fed grains. This rebuilds and repairs muscle tissues, keeps inflammation low and allows for healing.

* **Hypoallergenic Products:** Some individuals with sensitivities opt for hypoallergenic products that are formulated to minimize the use of common allergens and irritants. These products may be labeled as suitable for sensitive skin.

* **Avoidance and Substitution:** Managing household product sensitivities often involves avoiding products known to trigger reactions and substituting them with alternative, less irritating options.

* **Read product labels:** Choosing products labeled as "fragrance-free," "hypoallergenic," or "sensitive skin".

* **Symptoms:** Skin reactions (rashes, itching, redness), respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, wheezing), eye irritation, nasal congestion, headaches, and fatigue.

* **Symptoms:** Symptoms of chemical allergies can vary and may include skin rashes, itching, redness, hives, nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and in severe cases, anaphylaxis.

* **Environmental Sensitivities:** Some individuals may develop environmental sensitivities, often referred to as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), where they experience adverse reactions to a broad range of chemicals at lower exposure levels than typically tolerated by the general population.

* **Skin Allergies:** Contact dermatitis is a type of skin allergy caused by contact with allergens, including certain chemicals. Common allergens include nickel, preservatives, and fragrances in personal care products.

* **Diagnosis:** Patch testing and other allergy tests may be conducted to identify specific allergens.

* **Management:** The primary management strategy for chemical allergies involves avoiding exposure to the allergens. This may include using fragrance-free and hypoallergenic products, choosing natural cleaning agents, and minimizing exposure to known triggers.

* **Air Quality Considerations:** Individuals with chemical allergies may benefit from improving indoor air quality by using air purifiers with activated carbon filters and maintaining good ventilation. Avoiding smoking and minimizing exposure to indoor pollutants can also contribute to a healthier indoor environment.


When choosing hypoallergenic products, it's important to consider individual sensitivities and allergies. Some people may still be sensitive to specific ingredients, even in hypoallergenic formulations. Here are some tips:

Read Ingredient Lists: Check the ingredient lists of products to identify potential allergens.
Patch Test: Before using a new product, perform a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any adverse reactions.
Consult with Healthcare Professionals: Individuals with known allergies or sensitivities may benefit from consulting with dermatologists or allergists for personalized recommendations.

It's important to note that the term "hypoallergenic" is not regulated, and there is no standard definition. Therefore, individuals should carefully review product ingredients and choose products based on their specific needs and sensitivities.
