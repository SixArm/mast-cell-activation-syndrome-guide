Mupirocin ointment in nostrils. I have been for several months. The problem is that it wasn't getting that far back in the nasal cavity to work. I am now doing nasal rinses with it.

Antibiotics can‚Äôt work if the opening to a cavity is swelled shut. Antibiotics need oxygen to work. When my daughter was little she‚Äôd had non-stop sinus infections that wouldn‚Äôt respond to antibiotics. She was classified as having serious sinus disease at 5! I went from Dr to Dr trying to get one to investigate her sinuses surgically but no one would because it could stunt her nose growth. I finally got an ENT to go in and flush her sinuses. He agreed and found one swelled shut but got his instrument thru and said he washed a lot of gross stuff out. That night the poor little thing said - Mommy, I didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt supposed to hurt to breath. Broke my heart it took so long. She‚Äôs never had a sinus infection since and she‚Äôs 30.

Symptoms of Mold Toxicity
We have a special word in medicine that describes a symptom so specific that the mere mention of it is sufficient, at times, to make a clear diagnosis. That word is pathognomonic (‚Äúpath-og-no-mon-ic‚Äù). It is particularly relevant to mold toxicity in that quite a few symptoms are so particular to patients with mold toxicity that we immediately gravitate toward that diagnosis. Specifically, they are:
‚ñ† Electric shock sensations
‚ñ† Ice pick‚Äìlike pains
‚ñ† Vibrating or pulsing sensations running up and down the spinal cord (sometimes confined to specific segments of the spine)
If these descriptions are associated with many of the symptoms listed below, particularly muscle weakness, numbness and tingling in different parts of the body, disequilibrium, dizziness, severe anxiety and depression with fatigue and cognitive impairment, joint and muscle pain, headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and chest tightness and pain, the possibility of mold toxicity should immediately jump to mind.

‚Äôve recently noticed that Boswellia Serrata (Indian frankincense) extract was substantially reducing my MCAS inflammatory response to trigger foods. The improvement was quite noticeable, definitely not as good as hydrocortisone (steroid) tablets, but in the same ballpark. 
I want to contribute more ideas to this community so that we can all manage our MCAS better. So far I‚Äôve personally Ôøºfound improvements with both ozone therapy and Boswellia capsules, neither of which I have ever seen recommended for MCAS.
I currently take Xyzal (Levocetirizine), and ketotifen which seem to have less noticeable benefits over time, but I definitely found Boswellia provided me with noticeably more relief when used as an addition
o my regimen. 
I wanted to know if any of you have found the same benefit from Boswellia Serrata capsules. In my case, it very much does seem to be dose-dependent in that two capsules provided me much more relief than one. I do not notice the same benefit from curcumin or fish oil, which I also take. 
Not only did the Boswellia help me with joint pain and inflammation, but I felt that it also increased my mental clarity to some extent which must mean it also reduced my neuroinflammation.
There are many studies on PubMed that appear to demonstrate that Boswellia may block inflammation via multiple different pathways including leuoktrienes, NF-kB, COX1 and COX2 . Here‚Äôs one quote from PubMed:

Well I had been tolerating gabapentin for years until I went up to actually taking it 3 times a day as prescribed. I had a minor surgery november 29th. They gave me morphine, then tried norco (hydrocodone/ acetominophen), then tylenol with codeine, then tramadol. They all caused me to have terrifying syncopal seizures that got me re-admitted to the hospital a month later. The seizures got better after I stopped the pain meds and were more intense with the stronger pain meds. I had to stop all of them, including the gabapentin that also began causing seizures after the other meds started triggering them. I have pretty debilitating chronic pain and currently can‚Äôt take any pain meds without it taking me down.

Joy Lyons I haven‚Äôt heard of that. I‚Äôll look into it. What I am using currently for my pain & muscle spasms is RSO or Rick Simpson Oil. It‚Äôs a full plant cannabis extract and considered the best of the best for medical cannabis options. It comes in a little squirt syringe and is a thick goo. You only take a drop the size of a grain of rice and you have to work up to that a little. I put it on one of my pills I‚Äôm taking anyways. You can rub it on your gums for faster absorption but it‚Äôs sticky and doesn‚Äôt taste great so i really recommend the pill method.

Rebecca Dawn the CBG oil does not taste bad at all, I can share the link if you want me to. The great thing about this company is that they have a 60% discount for low income. So it drops each bottle down to $16!! Some people need a higher dose than the 100 mg for it to work for the pain. But it all depends on the person üòÉ

My immunologist told me to start reintroducing foods after I had 4 weeks of no reactions (no more losing the 5-6 remaining foods I have). I have been having reactions to hear, cold & exercise, but thought the food reintro‚Äôs pertained to no food reactions. 
         I decided on my favorite organic, non GMA cracker from the past (to give my body a break from rice if it worked out). Only ingredients are organic nongmo wheat flour and water. (Am not celiac and not reactive to organic wheat. My body did very well with these in the past; high in fiber and protein.) 
          I took my Cromolyn, waited 39 minutes, then broke off 2 small bites of the cracker to try. After the first bite my mouth badly a little odd‚Äîbut no immediate reaction (I typically get immediate reactions). After 1 minute I chew and eat the 2nd small bite. That‚Äôs it for the initial try. My tongue started to get itchy, then 2 minutes later my mouth was itchy. Then I had esophageal gurgling for several seconds and I started hiccuping (what the heck?? Is this a sign of reaction? I don‚Äôt ever hiccup). My throat become sore and a headache started‚ÄîI took 2 Benadryl. Then my intestines became unhappy, I my inner ear canals and scalp itched badly. The Benadryl is kicking in already (it‚Äôs been an hour from that first bite) and am feeling off.. the mouth and throat are still prickly & intestines are still unhappy but I don‚Äôt think things will progress from here. 
         Did I try to reintroduce something (a previously safe food staple) too soon? 
Background:  I have not had an Ana, or bad food reaction in about 6 weeks. I‚Äôve stayed with the same 5-6 foods (I lost all others, mostly to Ana) and my body has not rejected any more of these (not many left TO reject). I lost most if my foods July -October of last year.. lost 1/2 my then-remaining foods in early November. Have  been on Cromolyn‚Äîthis time for 4 weeks, am increasing at a drop at a time and am currently at 6 drops in the morning & 4 drops at bedtime; just finished the last round of pushback reaction to that latest increase so will stay here a week before increasing another drop. Am on week 3 of  Ketotifen‚Äî0.5mg in the morning and at night. It‚Äôs really improved my breathing issues (wheezing/asthma are part of my reactions. I run 2 good air purifiers 24/7 but only the Ketotifen has helped with that since MCAS has taken over my life.) I drink home-distilled water (reactive to all water but this).  
        Should I wait until my foods have been stable longer? What‚Äôs a good, safe  time frame?  Should I wait until systemic reactions (heat, cold, odors, exercise) have also settled down? (They occur frequently.) My immunologist is good, but pushing me to reintroduce asap soon as possible. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs wise for me given that I‚Äôm still hoping to hold onto what little I have left. Am also taking H1 three times a day, H2 at night, hydroxyzine in addition if having a reaction to cold/heat/odors (meds overseen by my immunologist & pcp)‚Äîin addition to the Cromolyn (increasing slowly) and compounded Ketotifen (to be increased in 3 weeks to 1mg morning and night). Am allergic (IGE) to Singulair & Xolair those those are not options. 
           Now headache is bad, intestinal cramping, feeling anxiety trying to creep up. I‚Äôm safe & good here, I do have an Epi if needed but nowhere near that. Am not asking for medical advice‚Äîam asking for your experience in reintroducing foods. What was the timeframe you started? Did you wait longer until you were more ‚Äústable‚Äù and non reactive (if that even happens with MCAS for some of us)? Seeking the wisdom of your collective experiences specifically regarding food reintroduction experiences. TYIA! (Am deathly allergic to all supps except my current 4, so no supplement recommendations please. I Do not have mold, candida, SIBO, parasites or Lyme. Am cross posting to gain more experiences if others. Again, thank you!)
