Cross-reactive Carbohydrate Determinants (CCD): These are rarely associated with allergic reactions, but may produce positive in-vitro test results to CCD-containing allergens from pollen, plant food, insects and venoms.

Lipid transfer protein (nsLTP): Sensitization to LTPs is often associated with allergic reactions to fruit and vegetables in regions where peaches and closely related fruits are cultivated and is associated with systemic reactions in addition to OAS. LTP proteins are stable to heat and digestion causing reactions also to cooked foods

Parvalbumins are major allergens in fish and markers for cross-reactivity among different species of fish.

Cross-reactive components / Serum albumin / A protein present in different animal fluids and tissues, e.g blood, milk, meat (e.g. beef) and egg. Cross-reactions between
albumins from different animal species are well known, for example between cat and dog or cat and pork.

An actin-binding protein in muscle fibers. A marker for cross-reactivity between crustaceans, 
mites and cockroaches.

Birch or related Fagales tree pollens are often the primary sensitizer to PR-10 proteins in areas with high exposure to these pollens. The presence of PR-10 proteins in many plant foods can cause allergic reactions to fruits, nuts and vegetables due to cross-reactivity, and is often associated with local symptoms such as oral allergy syndrom (OAS). Many of these proteins are heat labile and cooked foods are often tolerated.

Profilins show great homology and cross-reactivity even between distantly related plant species. Seldom associated with clinical symptoms but may cause demonstrable or even severe reactions in a minority of patients allergic to e.g. citrus fruits, melon, banana, litchi and tomato.

Cross-reactive Carbohydrate Determinants (CCD) are rarely associated with allergic reactions, but may produce positive in-vitro
test results to CCD-containing allergens from pollen, plant food, insects and venoms.

Polcalcin: this is a calcium-binding 2-EF-hand protein.
