The Immuno Solid-phase Allergen Chip (ISAC) test identifies specific allergens that trigger allergic reactions in individuals. Results: positive result to a specific allergen can tell you what to avoid or minimize, such as a specific plant, specific food, or specific chemical. 

The Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) test looks for the presence of autoantibodies targeting components of the cell nucleus, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. Results: A positive ANA test result may suggest the presence of an autoimmune disease.

The Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPOAb) test identifies autoantibodies that can lead to inflammation and damage to the thyroid gland. The TPOAb test is commonly used for autoimmune thyroid disorders, particularly Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease.

The Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA) Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Proteinase 3 (PR3) test looks for autoantibodies that target proteins found in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. Results: Positive results suggest systemic vasculitis, or inflammation of the respiratory tract, and more.

Basophil histamine receptor testing assesses the responsiveness of basophils to histamine. Basophils are a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions. Results: Increased expression of activation markers suggests an increased allergic response.

The C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) test measures the levels and activity of C1-INH protein in the blood. C1-INH helps control inflammation and prevents excessive activation of the complement cascade. Results: Low results are indicative of angioedema.

The Complement C3 C4 test measures the the levels of complement proteins C3 and C4 in the blood. The complement system manages immune responses and inflammations. Result: Low levels suggest complement deficiencies; high levels suggest acute-phase reactions, inflammation, or infections.



are key components of the complement system, a group of proteins that play a central role in the innate immune response
