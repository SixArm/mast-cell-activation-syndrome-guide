Whipped tallow for lotion


Jojoba oil mixed with essential oils for skin. When it‚Äôs cold I use pure shea and Matys baby ointment on chapped and dry skin.


If you can get contact allergy testing I highly recommend it. It helped me figure out I‚Äôm allergic to several VERY common ingredients like propylene glycol is one of them. PG is even in the allergist dermatologist approved products like Vanicream. I personally use Aquaphor ointment, multiple Ecoslay products for my hair, I make a honey scrub body wash and I use several of Stawberry Hegehog‚Äôs soaps and their shampoo bar. My skin prefers the honey scrub I make without any soap


Vanicream! Face and body lotion. Rose hip oil added into those.
Shampoos can be hit or miss for me so I cycle them.

I‚Äôve had to switch everything to vainicream and everything scent free. Laundry soap, dish soap, lotion, dry shampoo, shampoo and conditioner, everything!! I did skin patch testing and found out I have an allergy and I didn‚Äôt have one safe product I was using.

I recommend using Korean skin care.

Innersense clarity shampoo and conditioner


vegan formula Garnier Fructis Pure Clean for shampoo and conditioner. And I switched to Dr Bronner's unscented baby soap for body wash. 

So far it's helped. I lotion down in Cetaphil so far.


olaplex and sunbum shampoo, but like to rotate .


No Nothing and Fragfree have been good for us.

Druide, carina, attitude, shes butter brand Now

* [Bondi Boost](https://www.bondiboost.co.uk/)


Hydrogen water. It‚Äôs a mast cell stabilizer anyhow.

Cetaphil face wash and moisturizer for my face.

* [Aveeno - Eczema Therapy Nighttime Itch Relief Balm](https://www.aveeno.com/products/eczema-therapy-nighttime-itch-relief-balm)

* I can also use LUSH products without issues most of the time but they are pricey.

Carina organics for hair and face. Def doesn‚Äôt lather like a standard chemically derived shampoo so I end up using 2x as much shampoo as conditioner and needing to do two rounds of washing. Kind of annoying but they pay very careful attention to their ingredients.
Currently trying new body wash/lotions as my favorite (alaffia) changed their recipes and I had a terrible experience with ordering off their website and getting a different ingredient blend than what was listed online!

Avoid citric acid which is found in many natural/organic products. It‚Äôs a tough one to avoid.

I also get these when I‚Äôm having a major chocolate craving. They are pricey but come in a 2-pack. I only eat one at a time and have found it hasn‚Äôt bothered me and it definitely hits the chocolate craving. Which honestly is quite impressive bc I used to sit and eat a bowl of reese cups with a side of crunch bars like it was nothing!! üòÇüòÇ Hope this helps‚Ä¶ xoxo

I really love Sietes Dip Chips
Apple sauce, celery, cucumber, carrots, rice cake, macadamia nut butter with apple slices, popped sorghum with ghee or coconut oil, pistachios, make ice cream with coconut milk and a fruit you tolerate well.
