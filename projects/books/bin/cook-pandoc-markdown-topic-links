# Our Markdown topic pages use sibling-directory links, such as:
#
#    [Foo Goo](../foo-goo)
#
#
# Pandoc Markdown PDF cannot correctly parse the sibling-directory links.
# Instead, the parser needs internal PDF link brackets that correspond
# to internal Pandoc-generated page headlines, such as:
#
#    [Foo Goo]
#
# This script cooks the build file, by deleting all of the
# sibling-directory URLS. This makes the parser successful.
