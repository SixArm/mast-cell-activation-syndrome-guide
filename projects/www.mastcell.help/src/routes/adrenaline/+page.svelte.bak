<h1 id="adrenaline">Adrenaline</h1>
<p>Adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the body’s “fight or flight” response to stress or danger. Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal glands on top of each kidney.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increased Blood Flow</strong>: Adrenaline stimulates the heart and also causes blood vessels to constrict in certain areas, to help blood flow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dilation of Airways</strong>: Adrenaline causes the bronchi (airways) in the lungs to dilate, allowing for increased airflow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dilation of Pupils</strong>: Adrenaline causes the pupils of the eyes to dilate (enlarge), improving vision in low-light conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobilization of Glucose</strong>: Adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver into glucose, to provides immediate energy for the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inhibition of Insulin Release</strong>: Adrenaline inhibits the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps glucose availability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Mental Alertness</strong>: Adrenaline can improve mental focus and alertness, allowing individuals to quickly assess and respond to situations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stimulation of Lipolysis</strong>: Adrenaline promotes the breakdown of fat stores (lipolysis) to release fatty acids into the bloodstream, for additional energy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emergency medication</strong>: Adrenaline is sometimes administered as a medication for severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, or acute asthma attacks.</p></li>
</ul>
