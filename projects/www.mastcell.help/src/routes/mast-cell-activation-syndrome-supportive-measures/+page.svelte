and therapy, can be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoidance of Triggers</strong>: Identifying and avoiding
environmental triggers, such as certain medications, insect stings, and
environmental allergens, can be important for symptom
management.</p></li>

exercise can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. However,
exercise should be tailored to an individualâ€™s specific needs and
limitations.</p></li>

a healthcare provider is essential to assess the effectiveness of
