<h1 id="kriya">Kriya</h1>
<p>Kriya typically refers to a set of yogic practices that involve specific actions, movements, or techniques aimed at achieving a particular outcome, such as physical health, mental clarity, or spiritual growth. Kriya can encompass a wide range of practices, from physical exercises and breathing techniques to meditation and mudras.</p>
<p><strong>Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Physical Kriyas</strong>: These are yogic practices that involve physical movements or postures. They may include dynamic sequences of yoga asanas (poses) designed to improve flexibility, strength, and overall physical health. Some examples of physical kriyas include Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations), specific sequences of hatha yoga poses, or kundalini yoga exercises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breathing Kriyas</strong>: Breathing exercises, known as pranayama, are an integral part of kriya yoga. These techniques involve controlling the breath to achieve specific effects on the body and mind. Breathing kriyas may include practices such as alternate nostril breathing (Nadi Shodhana), breath retention (Kumbhaka), or rapid breathing (Bhastrika).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meditation Kriyas</strong>: Meditation is a central practice in many yogic traditions, and kriya meditation techniques are designed to facilitate inner stillness, mental clarity, and spiritual growth. Meditation kriyas may involve visualization, concentration on specific energy centers (chakras), or repeating mantras (chanting).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cleansing Kriyas</strong>: Kriya yoga also includes practices aimed at purifying the body and mind. These may include techniques such as Shankhaprakshalana (a cleansing practice involving drinking saltwater and performing specific yoga poses), Neti (nasal cleansing), or Dhauti (cleansing of the digestive tract).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy Kriyas</strong>: Some kriyas focus on the manipulation and cultivation of energy within the body. These practices may involve working with subtle energy channels (nadis) and centers (chakras) to balance and harmonize the flow of prana (life force energy). Examples include practices from kundalini yoga, such as Kundalini awakening exercises or specific mudras (hand gestures) and bandhas (energy locks).</p></li>
</ul>
