<h1 id="wool-allergy">Wool allergy</h1>
<p>A wool allergy is an allergic reaction to proteins found in the fibers of wool. Wool is derived from the fleece of sheep and is commonly used in clothing, blankets, and other textiles. While wool is a natural and breathable material, some individuals may develop an allergic reaction to it.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Allergen in Wool:</strong> The allergenic component in wool is a protein called lanolin. Lanolin is a natural oil present in sheepâ€™s wool.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> May include redness, itching, rash, hives, sneezing or difficulty breathing, especially if exposed to airborne wool particles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact Dermatitis:</strong> The most common reaction to wool is contact dermatitis, which is an inflammatory skin condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Reactivity:</strong> Individuals with a wool allergy may also experience cross-reactivity with other animal fibers, such as angora or cashmere. This is because these fibers contain similar proteins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> A healthcare professional can diagnose a wool allergy through a combination of medical history, skin patch testing, and allergen-specific IgE blood tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management:</strong> The primary management strategy for a wool allergy is to avoid contact with wool and wool-containing products.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines and topical corticosteroids may be used to manage symptoms of contact dermatitis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Individuals with a known wool allergy should read clothing labels carefully, choose hypoallergenic fabrics, and avoid direct contact with wool.</p></li>
</ul>
