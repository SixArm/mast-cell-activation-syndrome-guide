<h1 id="platelet">Platelet</h1>
<p>Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small cell fragments found in the bloodstream. They play a crucial role in the bodyâ€™s ability to stop bleeding and form blood clots when blood vessels are injured.</p>
<p>Disorders related to platelets can lead to various bleeding or clotting problems. Some individuals may have clotting disorders, which can result in excessive clotting (thrombosis), while others may have bleeding disorders, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and easy bruising. Some specific platelet disorders include thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and thrombocytosis.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formation and Production</strong>: Platelets are formed in the bone marrow, just like red and white blood cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Life Cycle</strong>: Platelets have a relatively short life span, typically surviving in the bloodstream for about 8 to 10 days. Afterward, they are removed by the spleen and liver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Platelet Count</strong>: A platelet count is a common component of a complete blood count (CBC). Low counts (thrombocytopenia) can lead to a higher risk of bleeding and can result from various causes, including certain medical conditions, medications, and bone marrow disorders. High counts (thrombocytosis) can occur due to underlying medical conditions, such as inflammation, infections, or myeloproliferative disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medical Uses</strong>: Platelet transfusions can be used to treat patients with low platelet counts who are at risk of bleeding due to medical conditions, such as leukemia, chemotherapy, or bone marrow disorders. Platelet function tests, such as the bleeding time test and platelet aggregation studies, can help diagnose platelet disorders and assess platelet function.</p></li>
