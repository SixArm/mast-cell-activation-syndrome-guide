<li><p><strong>Moderate MCAS</strong>: Those with moderate MCAS may have more frequent or persistent symptoms that require ongoing medication management. Symptoms can affect daily life and may lead to some restrictions in activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severe MCAS</strong>: Severe MCAS is characterized by frequent, severe, and debilitating symptoms that may significantly impair an individual’s ability to function.
