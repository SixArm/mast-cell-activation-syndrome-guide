<p>Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody medication used for the treatment of certain allergic conditions. It is also known as brand name Xolair. Omalizumab is designed to target and inhibit the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody involved in allergic reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>: Omalizumab binds to the IgE antibodies circulating in the blood. This prevents IgE from attaching to immune cells and triggering the release of substances that contribute to allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Omalizumab is primarily used in the treatment of two conditions: allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives without a known cause).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administration</strong>: Omalizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection, usually once every two to four weeks, depending on the specific condition being treated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring and Side Effects</strong>: Regular monitoring is necessary during omalizumab treatment. Common side effects may include injection site reactions, headaches, viral infections, and upper respiratory tract infections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patient Eligibility</strong>: Eligibility for omalizumab is determined by healthcare providers based on the severity and nature of the allergic condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost and Insurance Coverage</strong>: Omalizumab can be an expensive medication, and insurance coverage may vary.</p></li>
