<h1 id="genetic-polymorphisms">Genetic polymorphisms</h1>
<p>Genetic polymorphisms, also known as genetic variations or genetic variants, are differences in the DNA sequence among individuals in a population.</p>
<p><strong>Key types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)</strong>: These polymorphisms involve a single base-pair change in the DNA sequence. For example, at a specific position in a gene, one person’s DNA might have an “A,” while another person’s DNA at the same position has a “G.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insertions and Deletions (Indels)</strong>: These polymorphisms involve the insertion or deletion of a small segment of DNA. Indels can cause frame shifts in a gene, potentially leading to altered protein function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy Number Variations (CNVs)</strong>: These polymorphisms involve the duplication or deletion of larger DNA segments, ranging from a few hundred base pairs to several megabases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chromosomal Rearrangements</strong>: These polymorphisms involve more extensive structural changes in chromosomes, such as translocations, inversions, and deletions or duplications of entire genes or chromosomal segments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Functional Consequences</strong>: Many genetic polymorphisms have functional consequences. They can affect gene expression, protein structure and function, traits, and disease susceptibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pharmacogenetics</strong>: Genetic polymorphisms play a role in how individuals respond to medications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic testing</strong>: Genetic testing, including direct-to-consumer genetic testing, is increasingly popular for assessing individual genetic polymorphisms.</p></li>
</ul>
