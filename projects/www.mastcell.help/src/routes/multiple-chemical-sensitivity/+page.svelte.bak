<p>Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic condition characterized by a heightened sensitivity to certain chemicals and environmental triggers. Individuals with MCS experience adverse reactions to various substances found in everyday environments, including pollutants, fragrances, cleaning products, pesticides, and other chemicals.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Respiratory symptoms: coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness. Neurological symptoms: headaches, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), difficulty concentrating, memory problems, or irritability. Dermatological symptoms: skin rashes, itching, or hives.

<li><p><strong>Triggers</strong>: <a href="../volatile-organic-compounds/">Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</a>, fragrances, biotoxins such as pesticides and herbicides, pollutants such as smoke and vehicle exhaust, indoor allergens, indoor toxins such as mold and mildew, electromagnetic fields (EMFs).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Use medical history, symptom evaluation, and exclusion of other medical conditions with similar symptoms. Individuals with MCS may undergo allergy testing, environmental testing, or provocation testing to identify specific triggers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Minimize exposure to triggers. Create a safe home environment by using non-toxic products and improving indoor air quality via good ventilation and air filtration. Use personal protective measures, such as masks and filters. Implement stress management techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Living with MCS can be challenging, as individuals may face difficulties in finding suitable environments, accessing healthcare services, and navigating social situations where chemical exposures are common.</p></li>
