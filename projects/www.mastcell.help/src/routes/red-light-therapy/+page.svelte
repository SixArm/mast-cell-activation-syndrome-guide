<h1 id="red-light-therapy">Red light therapy</h1>
<p>Red light therapy, also known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or photobiomodulation (PBM), is a non-invasive treatment that uses specific wavelengths of red or near-infrared light to stimulate cellular function. These wavelengths penetrate the skin and are absorbed by mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells. This absorption of light energy helps stimulate cellular metabolism, increase ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, and enhance cellular repair and regeneration processes.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Skin Rejuvenation</strong>: Red light therapy may help improve skin tone and texture, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and promote collagen production for a more youthful appearance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pain Relief</strong>: Red light therapy has been used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain, joint stiffness, and inflammation associated with conditions such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, and sports injuries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wound Healing</strong>: Red light therapy may promote faster healing of wounds, cuts, and burns by stimulating tissue repair and regeneration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hair Growth</strong>: Red light therapy has been studied as a potential treatment for hair loss (alopecia) by promoting blood flow to the scalp and stimulating hair follicle activity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mood Enhancement</strong>: Some research suggests that red light therapy may have mood-enhancing effects and could be beneficial for conditions such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sports Performance</strong>: Athletes may use red light therapy to enhance recovery, reduce muscle soreness, and improve performance after intense workouts or competitions.</p></li>
