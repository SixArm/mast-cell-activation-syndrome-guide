<h1 id="hypertryptasemia">Hypertryptasemia</h1>
<p>Hypertryptasemia refers to the presence of abnormally high levels of
tryptase in the blood. Tryptase is an enzyme that is primarily released
from mast cells, which are involved in the immune response.</p>
<p>There are several potential reasons for hypertryptasemia,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mast Cell Disorders</strong>: Elevated tryptase levels
are often associated with mast cell disorders, such as systemic
mastocytosis. In these conditions, mast cells are abnormally increased
in the body and can release excessive amounts of tryptase and other
inflammatory substances, leading to various symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allergic Reactions</strong>: Elevated tryptase levels can
occur during severe allergic reactions, particularly in cases of
anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that
can lead to a sudden and dramatic release of mast cell products,
including tryptase, into the bloodstream.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Conditions</strong>: Some other medical conditions,
such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and certain types of blood
disorders, may also lead to elevated tryptase levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hypertryptasemia is typically diagnosed through blood tests that
measure tryptase levels.</p>
<p>Treatment examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Anaphylaxis treatment requires immediate treatment with
adrenaline and supportive care.</p></li>
<li><p>Systemic mastocytosis treatment may involve medications to manage
symptoms and complications, such as antihistamines and mast cell
stabilizers.</p></li>
<li><p>If elevated tryptase is associated with an underlying medical
condition like CML, treatment will be directed at managing that
condition.</p></li>
</ul>
