<h1 id="methylene-blue">Methylene blue</h1>
<p>Methylene blue is a blue-colored medication and dye. It has medicinal properties, and also is used in laboratories for microscopic studies.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Methemoglobinemia Treatment</strong>: Methylene blue is used as an antidote for methemoglobinemia, a condition where there is an abnormal increase in the amount of methemoglobin in the blood. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen effectively. Methylene blue helps convert methemoglobin back to its normal, oxygen-carrying form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urinary Tract Infections</strong>: In some cases, methylene blue has been used as a treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has antibacterial properties and may help in reducing symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Antioxidant Properties</strong>: Methylene blue has antioxidant properties, which means it can help reduce oxidative stress in cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Photodynamic Therapy</strong>: Methylene blue is used in photodynamic therapy, a treatment that involves using light to activate a photosensitizing agent, such as methylene blue, to target and destroy abnormal cells, including cancer cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Central Nervous System Disorders</strong>: There is ongoing research into the potential use of methylene blue in the treatment of certain central nervous system disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Antifungal Properties</strong>: Methylene blue has demonstrated antifungal properties, and research is ongoing to explore its potential in the treatment of fungal infections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects and Precautions</strong>: Excessive amounts can lead to side effects, including methemoglobinemia. Individuals with a deficiency of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) may be at an increased risk of hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) when exposed to methylene blue.</p></li>
