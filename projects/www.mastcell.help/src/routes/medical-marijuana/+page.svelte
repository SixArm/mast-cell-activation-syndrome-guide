<h1 id="medical-marijuana">Medical marijuana</h1>
<p>Medical marijuana, also known as medical cannabis, refers to the use of the cannabis plant or its extracts to treat medical conditions and alleviate symptoms. The plant contains numerous compounds, including cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), which have potential therapeutic effects on the body.</p>
<p>One of the primary uses of medical marijuana is for pain management. THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, can reduce pain by acting on the bodyâ€™s endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating pain perception. Medical marijuana has been found to be particularly effective in treating chronic pain conditions such as neuropathic pain, arthritis, and cancer-related pain.</p>
<p>In addition to pain relief, medical marijuana is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with certain medical conditions. For example, it can help reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy, stimulate appetite in individuals with HIV/AIDS or cancer, and improve sleep quality in patients with insomnia.</p>
<p>Another potential benefit of medical marijuana is its anti-inflammatory properties. CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may be beneficial for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Despite its potential benefits, medical marijuana is not without risks. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, impaired coordination, and cognitive impairment. Long-term use of marijuana may also be associated with memory problems, dependence, and mental health issues, particularly in individuals predisposed to psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>The legal status of medical marijuana varies from country to country and within different regions. In some places, medical marijuana is legal and available by prescription for certain medical conditions. In others, it remains illegal or is only allowed for limited medical use.</p>
<p>Access to medical marijuana typically requires a recommendation from a healthcare provider or a medical marijuana card. Patients may obtain medical marijuana from licensed dispensaries, where a variety of products such as dried flower, oils, tinctures, edibles, and topical creams are available.</p>
