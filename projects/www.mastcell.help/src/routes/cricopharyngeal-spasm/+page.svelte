<h1 id="cricopharyngeal-spasm">Cricopharyngeal spasm</h1>
<p>Cricopharyngeal spasm, also known as upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction or cricopharyngeal dysfunction, is a condition characterized by the abnormal contraction of the cricopharyngeal muscle, which is a ring-like muscle at the top of the esophagus. This muscle normally helps prevent air from entering the esophagus during breathing and prevents reflux of stomach contents into the throat.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Throat pain or discomfort, such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) that feels like a sensation of food sticking in the throat or chest, or globus that feels like a lump or tightness in the throat unrelated to swallowing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: Unclear. May be associated with conditions such as <a href="/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>, neurological disorders, or psychological factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosis is typically based on the clinical presentation and may involve an endoscopy to examine the esophagus, a barium swallow study (a radiologic test to visualize the swallowing process), and esophageal manometry (a measure of muscle contractions and coordination in the esophagus).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment approaches may include therapy to improve swallowing and relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle; medications such as muscle relaxants or certain antidepressants; botox injections to relax the muscle, or surgery for severe cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Lifestyle and dietary modifications, such as eating smaller meals, avoiding late-night meals, and avoiding trigger foods, may help manage symptoms. Managing underlying conditions, such as GERD, may help.</p></li>
