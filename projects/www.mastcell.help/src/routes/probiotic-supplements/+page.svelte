<p>Probiotics are live microorganisms, mainly bacteria and yeast, that confer health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. Probiotic supplements are formulations designed to provide a concentrated source of these beneficial microorganisms.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Types</strong>: Probiotics can include various strains, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Live Cultures</strong>: To be effective, probiotics must contain live and viable cultures of microorganisms. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) indicates the quantity of live microorganisms present in a probiotic supplement.</p></li>
