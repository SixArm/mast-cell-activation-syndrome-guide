<p>The Swiss Interest Group Histamine Intolerance (SIGHI) publishes a simplified
histamine elimination diet for histamine intolerance. The diet is for people
with a DAO degradation disorder who have to avoid histamine, other biogenic
amines and DAO inhibitors in their diet.</p>

<p>Mast cell activation disorders are often mistaken for histamine intolerance. In
case of histamine sensitivity due to mast cell activation disorders (MCAD) this
dietary guideline is not sufficient. See the detailed list, which additionally
takes histamine liberators into consideration as completely as possible.</p>

<p>Everybody has to find out by trial and error what he/she can tolerate in what
quantities. Always read the list of ingredients to find out whether a food
contains incompatible ingredients. Freshness is important.</p>
<p>Compatibility is highly dependent on the individual sensitivity and the amount
consumed. It is temporarily affected by stress, hormones, and many other factors.</p>
