<h1 id="serum-tryptase-test">Serum tryptase test</h1>
<p>The serum tryptase test is a diagnostic tool used to measure the level of tryptase in the blood. Tryptase is an enzyme released by mast cells, a type of immune cell involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. This test is commonly used to assess mast cell activation.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary purpose of the serum tryptase test is to evaluate the activity of mast cells. Mast cells release various mediators, including tryptase, during an allergic or inflammatory response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions for Testing</strong>: Serum tryptase testing is often ordered when there is suspicion of mast cell disorders, such as systemic mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: A blood sample is taken from a vein, typically in the arm. The blood is collected in a tube and sent to a laboratory for analysis. The sample is usually drawn during a period of symptom exacerbation or as soon as possible after an event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Normal levels of tryptase are typically low, but they can temporarily increase in response to certain triggers. Persistent elevation of tryptase may suggest a chronic mast cell disorder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variations</strong>: There are different forms of tryptase, and the test may measure total tryptase or specific isoforms. Additionally, a “baseline” tryptase level is often established for an individual, and subsequent tests are compared to this baseline.</p></li>
