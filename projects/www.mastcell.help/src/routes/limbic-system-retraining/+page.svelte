<h1 id="limbic-system-retraining">Limbic system retraining</h1>
<p>Limbic system retraining refers to techniques aimed at improving the functioning of the limbic system. The limbic system is a complex set of brain structures involved that plays a crucial role in processing emotions, responding to stress, and regulating the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>The idea is that chronic stress, trauma, or prolonged illness can lead to dysregulation of the limbic system, contributing to persistent symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mind-Body Techniques</strong>: Use practices such as meditation, mindfulness, deep breathing, and relaxation techniques, to help regulate stress responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cognitive Restructuring</strong>: Identify and challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs that may contribute to stress or symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graded Exposure</strong>: Use gradual exposure to stimuli that trigger stress or symptoms. This enables individuals to build resilience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neuroplasticity Exercises</strong>: Use cognitive exercises, puzzles, and activities that engage the brain in novel ways, to help the brainâ€™s ability to reorganize and form new neural connections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emotional Regulation</strong>: Encourage self-compassion and develop skills for emotional regulation to improve overall well-being.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sleep Hygiene</strong>: Establish healthy sleep patterns, and address factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances.</p></li>
