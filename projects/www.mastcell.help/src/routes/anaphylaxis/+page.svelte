<h1 id="anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</h1>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. Anaphylaxis can affect multiple systems in the body and can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure and airway constriction, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>If you or someone you are with is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, seek emergency medical help immediately. Anaphylaxis can be fatal.</p>
<p>Common triggers for anaphylaxis include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Food Allergens</strong>: Foods like peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, and wheat are common triggers for anaphylaxis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insect Stings</strong>: Stings from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medications</strong>: Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contrast media used in medical imaging, can trigger anaphylactic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latex</strong>: Exposure to latex, often found in gloves and medical equipment, can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Allergens</strong>: Anaphylaxis can also be triggered by other allergens, such as latex, exercise-induced allergens, and allergens found in some occupational settings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anaphylaxis can recur, so itâ€™s crucial for individuals who have experienced it to follow up with an allergist or immunologist to identify the trigger, receive education on prevention, and develop a personalized anaphylaxis action plan. This plan may include carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and knowing how to use them.</p>
