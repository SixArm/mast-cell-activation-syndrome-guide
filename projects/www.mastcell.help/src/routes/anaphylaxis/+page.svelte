<h1 id="anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</h1>
<p>Anaphylaxis is a medical term that describes a potentially life-threatening reaction affecting multiple systems in the body.
Anaphylaxis can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure and airway constriction, making it difficult to breathe. Common triggers are food allergies (such as peanuts), animal venom (such as bee stings), certain medications (such as penicillin), certain chemicals (such as latex), and more.</p>
<p><strong>Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong>: This means an allergic reaction that effects multiple body systems, and can be mild, moderate, or severe i.e. life-threatening. See <a href="/anaphylaxis-severity/">analphylaxis severity</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anaphylactic shock</strong>: This means anaphylaxis that is most severe i.e. life-threatening. This must be treated immediately with a shot of adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) such as via an adrenaline auto-injector (such as brand name EPIPEN) and emergency medical care. Rescue medications such as antihistamines will not reliably act fast enough to stop this. A person who experiences anaphylactic shock must to be watched carefully for 12 hours to ensure the person recovers fully.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biphasic anaphylaxis</strong>: This means reactions come in two phases. The person may recover from the first reaction, but symptoms come back. This can occur up to 12 hours after the first reaction. The rebound may be milder, but the person may still need a second dose of epinephrine. This is why people who are at risk need to carry two adrenaline auto-injectors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protracted anaphylaxis</strong>: This means a persistent anaphylactic reaction that lasts hours to days without clearly resolving completely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anaphylaxis-like a.k.a. anaphylactoid reaction</strong>: This means a reaction that is much like anaphylaxis, except without any identifiable allergen. See <a href="/anaphylaxis-and-anaphlactoid/">anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid</a>. Anaphylactoid reactions can be mild, moderate, or severe i..e. life-threatening. Anaphylactoid shock must be treated immediately in the same way as anaphylactic shock. Biphasic anaphylactoid shock can happen. Protraced anaphylactoid reactions can happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Idiopathic anaphylaxis</strong>: This means a medical diagnosis when no specific trigger can be identified after an appropriate evaluation and when conditions, such as systemic mastocytosis, have been ruled out.</p></li>
</ul>
