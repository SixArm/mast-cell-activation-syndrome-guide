<p>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HI) are both conditions related to histamine dysregulation, but they have different underlying mechanisms and clinical features.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: MCAS is primarily an immune system disorder where mast cells, which are a type of immune cell, are activated and release excessive amounts of chemical mediators, including histamine. HI is primarily a metabolic issue where the body has difficulty breaking down and eliminating histamine, which leads to histamine levels exceeding the bodyâ€™s capacity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: In MCAS, mast cells become hyper-responsive and release their contents inappropriately, even in the absence of a real threat. In HI, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of enzymes involved in histamine metabolism, such as diamine oxidase (DAO).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Triggers</strong>: MCAS triggers can include stress, infections, certain foods, medications, and environmental exposures. HI triggers are typically allergens, or medications that interfere with DAO function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: MCAS can cause a diverse array of symptoms, at any time, ranging from slow allergy-like reactions to fast life-threatening anaphylactic shock, and can be unpredictable and vary from person to person. HI symptoms often resemble an allergic reaction, and typically occur after consuming histamine-rich foods or substances that inhibit DAO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: MCAS treatment emphasizes mast cell stabilizers and limbic system recovery, along with addressing probable causes such as toxins or infections. HI treatment emphasizes reducing histamine-rich foods, histamine liberators, and histamine reducers such as DAO supplements. Both MCAS and HI use symptom-specific medications such as antihistamines and anti-inflammatories.</p></li>
</ul>
