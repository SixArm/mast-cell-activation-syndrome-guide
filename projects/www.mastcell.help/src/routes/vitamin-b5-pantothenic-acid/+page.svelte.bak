<p>Vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenic acid) is a water-soluble B-vitamin that is essential for various bodily functions. Pantothenic acid is a key component of coenzyme A (CoA), which plays a critical role in many metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Energy Metabolism</strong>: Pantothenic acid is a crucial component of coenzyme A (CoA), which is involved in the conversion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy. CoA is also necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are used for energy storage and other cellular processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthesis of Fatty Acids</strong>: Pantothenic acid is required for the synthesis of fatty acids, which are important components of cell membranes and play various roles in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coenzyme A (CoA) Functions</strong>: CoA, derived from pantothenic acid, is a coenzyme that participates in numerous enzymatic reactions. It is essential for the metabolism of amino acids, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the breakdown of fatty acids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin Health</strong>: Pantothenic acid is often included in skincare products due to its potential benefits for skin health. It is believed to help maintain the moisture barrier of the skin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wound Healing</strong>: Some research suggests that pantothenic acid may play a role in wound healing processes, but further study is needed to confirm this effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficiency</strong>: This is uncommon and can lead to symptoms like fatigue, numbness and tingling in the extremities, and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dietary sources of pantothenic acid include meat (particularly organ meats), poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, whole grains, and legumes. It is widely distributed in nature, and deficiencies are relatively rare.</p>
