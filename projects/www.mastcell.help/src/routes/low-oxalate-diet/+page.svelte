<h1 id="low-oxalate-diet">Low-oxalate diet</h1>
<p>A low-oxalate diet is a dietary approach that restricts the intake of foods high in oxalates. Oxalates are natural compounds found in a variety of plant-based foods and are also produced by the human body. In individuals who are prone to kidney stones or have certain medical conditions, a low-oxalate diet may be recommended to reduce the risk of developing kidney stones or to manage related health issues.</p>
<p>Oxalates can bind with calcium in the body to form crystals, which can contribute to the development of kidney stones. Kidney stones are hard mineral deposits that can form in the kidneys and may cause pain and other complications when they block the urinary tract. By reducing dietary oxalate intake, it is believed that the risk of kidney stone formation can be minimized.</p>
