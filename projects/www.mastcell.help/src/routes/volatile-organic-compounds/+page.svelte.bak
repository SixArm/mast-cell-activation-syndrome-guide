<h1 id="volatile-organic-compounds-vocs">Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</h1>
<p>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are a group of organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at room temperature, meaning they can easily evaporate into the air. See also <a href="../activated-carbon-filters/">activated carbon filters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sources</strong>: VOCs can be released from a wide range of sources, including household products, building materials, furnishings, paints, solvents, varnishes, cleaning supplies, personal care products, vehicle exhaust, and industrial processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common VOCs</strong>: Examples of common VOCs include benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, ethylene glycol, and acetone, among others. Each VOC has its own set of potential health effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health Effects</strong>: Some VOCs can have short-term and long-term health effects. Short-term exposure may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, and dizziness. Long-term exposure to certain VOCs has been associated with respiratory, neurological, and other health problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indoor Air Quality</strong>: VOCs are a significant contributor to indoor air pollution. Adequate ventilation is crucial. Air filters and activated carbon filters can help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air Quality Testing</strong>: Air quality testing may be conducted to measure VOC levels in indoor environments. This can help identify specific sources and guide mitigation strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental Impact</strong>: Some VOCs can contribute to outdoor air pollution and the formation of ground-level ozone. Certain VOCs also play a role in the complex chemistry of smog formation.</p></li>
