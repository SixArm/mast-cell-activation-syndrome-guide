<h1 id="diamine-oxidase">Diamine oxidase</h1>
<p>Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme found in the body that plays a
crucial role in the breakdown of histamine, a biogenic amine that is
involved in various physiological processes. Histamine is released in
response to allergic and inflammatory reactions and is also present in
certain foods. Diamine oxidase helps regulate histamine levels in the
body by breaking down histamine into its metabolites.</p>
<p>Key aspectsâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Digestive Health: Diamine oxidase is mainly found in the small
intestine, where it helps to prevent the absorption of excessive
histamine from dietary sources. This is important because high histamine
levels can lead to digestive issues and food intolerances in some
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Histamine Metabolism: Diamine oxidase is one of the enzymes
responsible for breaking down histamine within the digestive system. It
does this by oxidizing histamine and converting it into its metabolites,
which are less biologically active.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplements: Some people may experience histamine intolerance, a
condition in which their bodies cannot adequately break down and
metabolize histamine. Diamine oxidase dietary supplements may help
manage symptoms, and available over the counter.</p></li>
