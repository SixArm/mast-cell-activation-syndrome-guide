<p>α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in pigmentation, inflammation, and appetite regulation. It is produced by the pituitary gland and is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), a precursor protein.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pigmentation:</strong> α-MSH stimulates melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin, hair, and eyes. It promotes the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immunomodulation:</strong> α-MSH can modulate immune cell activity and can reduce inflammation in various tissues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appetite Regulation:</strong> α-MSH interacts with receptors in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in appetite regulation. It has anorexigenic effects, meaning it can suppress appetite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thermoregulation:</strong> α-MSH plays a role in thermoregulation by affecting heat dissipation and energy balance in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neuroprotection:</strong> Some studies suggest that α-MSH may have neuroprotective effects and could be explored for potential therapeutic applications in neurological disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sexual Function:</strong> There is evidence to suggest that α-MSH may influence sexual behavior and reproductive functions.</p></li>
