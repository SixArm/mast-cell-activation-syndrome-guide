<h1 id="leaky-gut">Leaky gut</h1>
<p>“Leaky gut” is a term used to describe a condition where the lining of the gut becomes more porous, allowing substances to pass through that normally would not. Also known as increased intestinal permeability.</p>
<p><strong>Key treatments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Remove Potential Triggers</strong>: Identify and eliminate foods that contribute to inflammation, such as processed foods, refined sugars, gluten, and dairy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emphasize Good Foods</strong>: Try a whole foods-based diet rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Try foods that support gut health, such as bone broth, fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir), and high-fiber foods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prebiotics</strong>: Try prebiotic-rich foods that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Examples: garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, bananas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probiotics</strong>: Try probiotic-rich foods or supplements to support a healthy balance of gut bacteria.
Examples: yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gut-Supportive Supplements</strong>: Try supplements to support gut health. Examples: glutamine, quercetin, aloe vera, slippery elm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydration</strong>: This supports the mucosal lining of the gut.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stress Management</strong>: Practice stress-reducing techniques, as chronic stress can impact gut health. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or mindfulness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adequate Sleep</strong>: Prioritize quality sleep, as it plays a crucial role in overall health, including immune function and gut health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Activity</strong>: Engage in regular physical activity, as it can support overall health and may positively influence gut health.</p></li>
</ul>
