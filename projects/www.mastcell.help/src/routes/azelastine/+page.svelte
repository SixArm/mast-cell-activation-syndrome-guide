<h1 id="azelastine">Azelastine</h1>
<p>Azelastine is a medication primarily used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, and allergic conjunctivitis. Brand name: Astelin.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Azelastine is an antihistamine medication that works by blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. Histamine is responsible for causing symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny or stuffy nose, and watery eyes. By blocking histamine receptors, azelastine helps alleviate these allergy symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nasal Spray and Eye Drops</strong>: Azelastine is available in two main forms: nasal spray and eye drops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usage</strong>: Azelastine nasal spray is typically used as a twice-daily regimen, with one spray in each nostril in the morning and evening. The dosage may vary depending on the severity of symptoms and individual response to treatment. Azelastine eye drops are usually instilled into the affected eye(s) twice daily or as directed by a healthcare professional.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Onset of Action</strong>: Azelastine provides relatively rapid relief of allergy symptoms, with noticeable improvement in nasal congestion and other symptoms within 15 to 30 minutes after administration. The duration of action can last for several hours, providing sustained relief from allergic symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Common side effects of azelastine may include bitter taste or nasal irritation (with nasal spray), headache, drowsiness, or eye irritation (with eye drops). These side effects are usually mild and transient. In some cases, azelastine nasal spray may cause nosebleeds or a burning sensation in the nose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>: Azelastine should not be used in individuals who are hypersensitive to azelastine or any of the ingredients in the formulation. It is also contraindicated in individuals with severe nasal congestion, as it may exacerbate this condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precautions</strong>: Azelastine should be used with caution in individuals with a history of nasal septum ulceration, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma, as it may increase the risk of nasal irritation or bleeding. It should also be used with caution in individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma or urinary retention.</p></li>
