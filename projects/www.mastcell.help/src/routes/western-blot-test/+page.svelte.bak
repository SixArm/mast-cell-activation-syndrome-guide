<h1 id="western-blot-test">Western blot test</h1>
<p>The Western blot test, also known as immunoblotting, is a laboratory technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or cell lysate. It is widely used in molecular biology and biochemistry research, as well as in medical diagnostics.</p>
<p>In medical diagnostics, Western blotting can be used to detect specific antibodies in patient serum, such as in HIV testing.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Western blot test is commonly used to detect proteins, confirm protein expression, study protein unteractions, and investigate signaling pathways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: The Western blot separates proteins in the sample based on their size using gel electrophoresis. The results are incubated with specific primary antibodies that bind to the target protein(s) of interest. These antibodies are further processed. The results Are analyzed for their size and intensity using imaging software or autoradiography.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations</strong>: Western blotting requires specialized equipment and reagents, making it more time-consuming and costly compared to other protein detection methods. The technique is semi-quantitative and requires careful optimization to ensure accurate and reproducible results.</p></li>
</ul>
