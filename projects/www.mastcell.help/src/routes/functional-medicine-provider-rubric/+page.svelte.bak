<h1 id="functional-medicine---provider-rubric">Functional medicine - provider rubric</h1>
<p>These are my notes about how I choose a functional provider for mast cell issues. These notes are based on my own interactions with hundreds of providers, learning what helps and what causes errors.</p>
<p>If a provider says “root cause”, then ask their opinion of Causal Analysis based on System Theory (CAST). CAST tackles problems with multiple causes and multiple interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good response: “Yes we’ll use CAST”.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad response: “No we won’t use CAST” or the simplistic “one root cause for many conditions” or “many root causes for one condition”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a provider says “all the best tests”, then ask which ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good response: ISAC molecular blood testing, which does 122 allergens, and keeps you on your meds.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad response: any test that does fewer and/or forces you off your meds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If provider says “functional medicine”, then ask their opinion of traditional medicine.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good response: “We’ll try traditional medicine to see if it helps”. Examples are traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture and SAAT, traditional Egyptian medicine such as khellin and cromolyn, traditional Inuit medicine such fish oil and omega-3.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad response: Anything that talks down at traditional medicine.</p></li>
</ul>
