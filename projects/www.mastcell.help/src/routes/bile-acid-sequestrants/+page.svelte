<p>Bile acid sequestrants, also known as bile acid-binding resins or
simply bile sequestrants, are a class of medications primarily used to
lower high levels of cholesterol in the blood. They work by binding to
bile acids in the intestines, which reduces the reabsorption of bile
acids and cholesterol, ultimately leading to lower levels of LDL
(low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>How They Work: Bile acids are produced in the liver from cholesterol
and play a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.
Bile acid sequestrants are not absorbed into the bloodstream but work in
the gastrointestinal tract. They bind to bile acids in the small
intestine, forming complexes that are then excreted in the feces. The
body’s response to this loss of bile acids is to increase the conversion
of cholesterol into new bile acids, thus reducing the amount of
cholesterol in the blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses: Bile acid sequestrants are primarily prescribed to lower
elevated LDL cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol
(hypercholesterolemia). High LDL cholesterol is a risk factor for
atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. These medications can also
be used in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as
statins, to achieve better control of cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Common Bile Acid Sequestrants: There are a few different bile acid
sequestrants available, including Cholestyramine (a.k.a. brand name
Questran), Colesevelam (a.k.a. brand name Welchol), and Colestipol
(a.k.a. brand name Colestid).</p>
<p>Dosing and Administration: Bile acid sequestrants are typically taken
orally in the form of a powder or tablet. They are usually mixed with
water or another liquid and should be taken with meals to improve their
effectiveness. It’s important to follow the dosing instructions provided
by the healthcare provider or as indicated on the medication label.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Side Effects: Common side effects of bile acid sequestrants can
include constipation, bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort.
These side effects are usually mild and may improve over time. Some
people may also experience deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D,
E, K) over the long term, so monitoring and supplementation may be
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactions: Bile acid sequestrants can interact with other
medications and reduce their absorption. To prevent interactions, take
other medications at least one hour before or four to six hours after
taking a bile acid sequestrant. Always inform your healthcare provider
and pharmacist about all the medications and supplements you are
taking.</p></li>
<li><p>Contraindications: Bile acid sequestrants are generally not
recommended for individuals with a history of bowel obstructions,
certain gastrointestinal disorders, or high triglyceride levels. Your
healthcare provider will consider your specific medical history and
conditions when prescribing these medications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bile acid sequestrants are one option for managing high cholesterol,
but they are typically used when other dietary and lifestyle
interventions have not been sufficient to lower cholesterol levels or
when statins are not an option. It’s important to work closely with your
healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your
specific situation and to monitor your response to treatment.</p>
