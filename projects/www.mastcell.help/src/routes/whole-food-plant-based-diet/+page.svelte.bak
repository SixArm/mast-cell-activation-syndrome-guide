<h1 id="whole-food-plant-based-wfpb-diet">Whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet</h1>
<p>A whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet is a dietary pattern centered around whole, minimally processed plant foods. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, while minimizing or excluding animal products and processed foods.</p>
<p>A WFPB diet is also more environmentally sustainable compared to diets high in animal products. Plant-based diets typically have a lower carbon footprint, require fewer natural resources (such as water and land), and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Health benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reduced risk of chronic diseases</strong>: A WFPB diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and other chronic conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weight management</strong>: Whole plant foods are generally lower in calories and higher in fiber, which can help promote satiety and support weight loss or weight maintenance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved gut health</strong>: The fiber and prebiotics found in plant foods can support a healthy gut microbiome, which is associated with improved digestion and immune function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better blood sugar control</strong>: Whole plant foods have a lower glycemic index and are less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar levels, making them beneficial for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.</p></li>
</ul>
