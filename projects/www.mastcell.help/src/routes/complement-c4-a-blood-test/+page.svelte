<h1 id="complement-c4-a-blood-test">Complement C4-A blood test</h1>
<p>A Complement C4-A blood test measures the levels of complement component 4A (C4-A) in the blood. The complement system is a part of the immune system that plays a crucial role in the bodyâ€™s defense against infections and the clearance of damaged or abnormal cells. Complement C4-A is a specific subtype of the complement protein C4.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Complement System</strong>: The complement system consists of a group of proteins that work together to enhance the immune response. Complement proteins play roles in inflammation, opsonization (marking of pathogens for destruction), and cell lysis (breaking down of cells).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abnormalities</strong>: Abnormalities in complement proteins, including C4-A, may be seen in conditions such as autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hereditary angioedema, infections, and certain kidney diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Variants</strong>: Some individuals may have genetic variations in the C4-A gene, leading to different levels of C4-A protein production. These variations are associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnostic Marker</strong>: Testing complement C4-A levels in the blood can be used as a diagnostic marker for certain autoimmune conditions. Low levels or deficiencies in complement C4-A may suggest an increased risk or presence of autoimmune diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring Disease Activity</strong>: In some cases, complement C4-A levels may be monitored over time to assess disease activity and response to treatment in autoimmune conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
