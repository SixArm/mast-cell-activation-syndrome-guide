<h1 id="shine-protocol">SHINE protocol</h1>
<p>The SHINE protocol is an acronym that stands for Sleep, Hormones, Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. It can improve the health of individuals who are experiencing conditions like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME).</p>
<p><strong>SHINE stands for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: Restorative sleep is crucial for overall health. Sleep disturbances are common in conditions like CFS and ME. The SHINE protocol emphasizes strategies for improving sleep quality, including addressing issues like sleep apnea, insomnia, and circadian rhythm disruptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormones</strong>: Hormonal imbalances can play a role in CFS and related conditions. This component of the protocol involves assessing and optimizing hormone levels, including thyroid hormones, adrenal hormones (cortisol), and sex hormones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infections</strong>: Infections, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, have been suggested as potential triggers for CFS and ME. The protocol includes the evaluation and treatment of any underlying infections or imbalances in the gut microbiome.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Nutrition is a critical component of the protocol. It focuses on addressing deficiencies, providing the body with essential nutrients, and reducing food allergies and sensitivities. Proper nutrition is seen as essential for supporting the body’s healing and energy production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Appropriate exercise is a key element of the protocol. It involves gradually increasing physical activity levels, guided by the patient’s tolerance, to help improve physical conditioning and prevent deconditioning. Overexertion can worsen symptoms in CFS and ME, so a careful and gradual approach to exercise is emphasized.</p></li>
</ul>
