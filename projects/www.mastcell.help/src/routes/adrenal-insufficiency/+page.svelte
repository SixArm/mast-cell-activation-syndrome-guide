<h1 id="adrenal-insufficiency">Adrenal insufficiency</h1>
<p>Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, is a rare but serious condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and, in some cases, aldosterone. The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney, and play a crucial role in producing hormones that regulate bodily functions.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: The most common causes include autoimmune disorders where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the adrenal glands. Other causes may include infections, tumors, or certain medications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, salt cravings, nausea, vomiting, and darkening of the skin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cortisol and Aldosterone Deficiency</strong>: Cortisol is a hormone essential for regulating metabolism, blood sugar, and stress response. Aldosterone helps regulate sodium and potassium levels in the body, affecting blood pressure and fluid balance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Blood tests measure cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. Imaging tests such as CT scans may identify damage or abnormalities in the adrenal glands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: The main treatment is hormone replacement therapy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emergency Situations</strong>: Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening situation that can occur when cortisol levels drop significantly. It requires immediate medical attention and treatment with intravenous (IV) <a href="/corticosteroids/">corticosteroids</a> and fluids.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic</strong>: Addison’s disease is typically a chronic, lifelong condition.</p></li>
</ul>
