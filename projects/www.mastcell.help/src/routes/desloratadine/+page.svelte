<h1 id="desloratadine">Desloratadine</h1>
<p>Desloratadine is a second-generation antihistamine medication used primarily for the treatment of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives). It provides rapid and long-lasting relief of symptoms with once-daily dosing, making it a convenient option. Brand name: Clarinex.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>: Desloratadine belongs to the class of antihistamine drugs known as H1 receptor antagonists. It works by selectively blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, thereby alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, itching, runny nose, and watery eyes caused by allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Desloratadine is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial) and chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children aged 6 months and older. It is used to alleviate symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, runny nose, watery eyes, and skin rash or hives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dosage and Administration</strong>: The usual dosage of desloratadine for adults and children aged 12 years and older is 5 mg taken orally once daily, with or without food. For children aged 6 months to 11 years, the recommended dosage varies based on weight and is typically administered as a syrup formulation. Desloratadine is typically taken with water, with or without food.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Onset and Duration of Action</strong>: Desloratadine has a relatively rapid onset of action, with symptom relief typically occurring within 1 to 3 hours after administration. The duration of action is generally 24 hours per dose, allowing for once-daily dosing for sustained relief of allergic symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety and Side Effects</strong>: Desloratadine is generally well-tolerated when used at recommended doses. It has a lower incidence of sedation and central nervous system (CNS) side effects compared to first-generation antihistamines. Common side effects may include headache, dry mouth, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or abdominal pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>: Desloratadine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients in the formulation. It should not be used in patients with severe liver impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Special Populations</strong>: Desloratadine is considered safe for use in elderly patients and those with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary in these populations based on individual patient factors.</p></li>
