<h1 id="blood-cells">Blood cells</h1>
<p>Blood is composed of various types of cells that serve different
functions in the body. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, a
spongy tissue found within the cavities of certain bones.</p>
<p>Blood cell counts and the ratio of these cells are essential for
maintaining overall health and preventing various medical conditions.
Regular blood tests, such as complete blood counts (CBC), can provide
valuable information about the levels and health of these blood
cells.</p>
<p>The main types of blood cells:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Red Blood Cells (RBCs) (a.k.a. erythrocytes): Red blood cells are
the most abundant type of blood cell in the body. Their primary function
is to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues and organs
and carry carbon dioxide, a waste product, from the tissues back to the
lungs for exhalation.</p></li>
<li><p>White Blood Cells (WBCs) (a.k.a. leukocytes): White blood cells
are a key part of the body’s immune system and are responsible for
defending the body against infections and foreign invaders. White blood
cells can identify and destroy pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and
fungi, as well as remove damaged or dead cells from the body.</p></li>
<li><p>Platelets (a.k.a. thrombocytes): Platelets are small cell
fragments that play a vital role in blood clotting and the prevention of
excessive bleeding. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets aggregate
at the site of the injury, stick together, and release chemical signals
that initiate the clotting process. Platelet aggregation and clot
formation are essential for wound healing and preventing excessive blood
loss.</p></li>
</ul>
