<h1 id="mineralocorticoids">Mineralocorticoids</h1>
<p>Mineralocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that play a crucial role in regulating electrolyte and water balance in the body. The primary mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which is produced by the adrenal glands, specifically in the outer layer known as the adrenal cortex.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Functions</strong>: Mineralocorticoids, particularly aldosterone, influence the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium in the kidneys. This helps maintain the balance of sodium and potassium in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions</strong>: Hyperaldosterone causes increased sodium retention, potassium excretion, and high blood pressure. Hypoaldosteronism causes decreased sodium retention, increased potassium levels, and low blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medications</strong>: Synthetic forms of mineralocorticoids, such as fludrocortisone, may be prescribed in certain medical conditions. Fludrocortisone is commonly used in conditions like Addisonâ€™s disease to replace deficient aldosterone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feedback Mechanism</strong>: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in regulating mineralocorticoid release. Factors such as low blood pressure, low sodium levels, or high potassium levels stimulate the release of renin, leading to the production of aldosterone.</p>
