<h1 id="genetic-mutation">Genetic mutation</h1>
<p>A genetic mutation is an alteration in the DNA sequence of an
organism’s genome. These mutations can occur naturally or as a result of
external factors. These mutations can lead to a wide range of effects,
from no discernible impact to significant changes in an organism’s
traits and characteristics.</p>
<p>Genetic mutations are a fundamental driver of evolution and are
central to the understanding of genetics and inherited traits.</p>
<p>Genetic testing can identify mutations associated with genetic
disorders and provide valuable information for healthcare, reproductive
planning, and personalized medicine.</p>
<p>Types of Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Point Mutations</strong>: These are small-scale mutations
that involve the substitution, addition, or deletion of a single
nucleotide in the DNA sequence. The most common type is a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Insertions and Deletions (Indels)</strong>: These
mutations involve the insertion of new nucleotides or the removal of
existing ones, which can shift the reading frame and cause significant
changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chromosomal Rearrangements</strong>: These are
large-scale mutations that affect the structure and number of
chromosomes. Examples include translocations, inversions, and
aneuploidy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duplication and Deletion Mutations</strong>: These
involve the copying of segments of DNA or the loss of specific DNA
segments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Causes of Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spontaneous Mutations</strong>: These mutations occur
naturally during DNA replication or cell division due to errors in the
DNA replication process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Induced Mutations</strong>: These mutations are caused by
external factors such as radiation, chemicals, and certain environmental
influences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Effects of Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Silent Mutations</strong>: Some mutations have no
observable impact on an organism’s traits or health. They occur in
non-coding regions of DNA or code for the same amino acid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missense Mutations</strong>: These mutations result in
the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein encoded by
the gene, potentially altering protein function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nonsense Mutations</strong>: These mutations create a
premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated, non-functional
protein.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frameshift Mutations</strong>: These mutations, such as
insertions or deletions, alter the reading frame of the gene, affecting
all amino acids downstream.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inheritance of Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Somatic Mutations</strong>: These mutations occur in
non-reproductive cells and are not passed on to offspring. They can lead
to diseases like cancer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Germline Mutations</strong>: These mutations occur in the
reproductive cells (sperm and eggs) and can be inherited by
offspring.</p></li>
</ul>
