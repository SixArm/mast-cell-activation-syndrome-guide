<h1 id="colesevelam">Colesevelam</h1>
<p>Colesevelam is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol and to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Brand name: Welchol.</p>
<p>Colesevelam belongs to the class of drugs known as bile acid sequestrants, similar to cholestyramine. Like cholestyramine, colesevelam works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, preventing their reabsorption and leading to increased excretion in the feces. This triggers the liver to produce more bile acids from cholesterol, thus reducing cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, colesevelam can also help improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes by reducing the absorption of glucose and improving insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>Colesevelam is typically taken orally in tablet form with meals. Common side effects may include constipation, stomach pain, nausea, indigestion, and headache. As always, it’s important to follow your doctor’s instructions when taking any medication and to discuss any concerns or potential side effects.</p>
