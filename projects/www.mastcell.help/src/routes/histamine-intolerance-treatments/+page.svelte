<h1 id="histamine-intolerance-treatments">Histamine intolerance: treatments</h1>
<p>Histamine intolerance treatment typically involve identifying and addressing factors that contribute to histamine accumulation and symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Common approaches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identify Triggers</strong>: Keep a diary to track symptoms and identify specific triggers, such as foods, pollens, or chemicals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low-Histamine Diet</strong>: Adopt a low-histamine diet to reducing the intake of foods rich in histamine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Supplements</strong>: DAO is the enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probiotics</strong>: Probiotic supplements or foods rich in probiotics, such as yogurt and kefir, may be beneficial to maintain a healthy gut microbial profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Gut Issues</strong>: Treating conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or leaky gut syndrome can improve histamine metabolism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Antihistamine Medications</strong>: Use over-the-counter antihistamine medications, such as cetirizine (H1 blocker) or ranitidine (H2 blocker).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Alcohol</strong>: Limit alcohol because it can interfere with histamine metabolism and contribute to symptom exacerbation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid Trigger Medications</strong>: Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some prescription medications, can contribute to histamine release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduce Stress</strong>: Stress can trigger or exacerbate symptoms. Try meditation, deep breathing, yoga, and relaxation exercises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hydrate</strong>: Drinking plenty of water helps flush out toxins, including excess histamine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liver Support</strong>: Some individuals explore dietary or lifestyle practices aimed at supporting liver function, as the liver plays a role in histamine metabolism.</p></li>
</ul>
