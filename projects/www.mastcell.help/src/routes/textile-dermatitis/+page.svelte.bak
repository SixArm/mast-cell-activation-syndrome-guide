<h1 id="textile-dermatitis">Textile dermatitis</h1>
<p>Textile dermatitis, also known as allergic contact dermatitis from textiles, is a type of skin irritation or inflammation that occurs as a result of direct contact with certain fabrics or materials. It is a form of contact dermatitis, which is a localized skin reaction caused by exposure to an allergen or irritant.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Chemical causes</strong>: Textile dermatitis can be caused by substances present in fabrics, including dyes, finishing agents, flame retardants, waterproofing treatments, formaldehyde resins, and other chemicals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fiber causes</strong>: Some individuals may experience dermatitis due to natural fibers like wool or plant-based fibers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metal causes</strong>: Metal components in clothing, such as snaps, buttons, or zippers made of nickel, can also cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals. Nickel allergy is a common cause of skin irritation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Common symptoms of textile dermatitis include redness, itching, rash, swelling, or blisters, all in the areas of skin that come into contact with the fabric.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosis is typically based on a thorough [medical history](../medical-history/), including information about exposure to specific fabrics, and clinical examination. In some cases, patch testing may be done to identify the specific allergens causing the reaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topical Treatments</strong>: Over-the-counter or prescription topical corticosteroids and <a href="../antihistamines/">antihistamines</a> may be used to alleviate symptoms of itching and inflammation associated with textile dermatitis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: The primary treatment strategy for textile dermatitis is to avoid contact with the problematic fabrics or triggers.</p></li>
