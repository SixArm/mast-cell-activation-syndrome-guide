<h1 id="cusack-protocol">Cusack protocol</h1>
<p>The Cusack protocol is a treatment for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and various other symptoms. The protocol focuses on a multidisciplinary approach to symptom management and aims to improve quality of life for individuals with hEDS.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Physical Therapy</strong>: Focus on improving joint stability, strength, and proprioception. Therapeutic exercises, manual therapy techniques, and functional training may be incorporated. The goal is to enhance joint function, reduce pain, and minimize the risk of injury.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orthotics and Assistive Devices</strong>: Custom orthotics, braces, splints, or other assistive devices can provide support and stability to hypermobile joints and reduce the risk of joint dislocations or injuries. This helps improve biomechanical alignment, alleviate pain, and enhance mobility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pain Management</strong>: May include medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and low-dose tricyclic antidepressants for neuropathic pain. Non-pharmacological approaches may include heat or cold therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain coping skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Management</strong>: Education about hEDS, its symptoms, and management strategies is an essential component of the Cusack protocol. Empowering individuals with knowledge about their condition enables them to better understand and manage their symptoms, advocate for themselves in healthcare settings, and make informed decisions about their care. Self-management techniques such as pacing, energy conservation, low-impact exercise, stress management, and relaxation techniques may also be taught to help individuals cope with the challenges of living with hEDS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Psychological Support</strong>: Psychological support and counseling may be beneficial for individuals with hEDS to address the emotional and psychosocial impact of living with a chronic condition. Counseling or therapy can help individuals develop coping strategies, manage anxiety or depression, and improve overall well-being.</p></li>
