<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints but can also impact other parts of the body. It is characterized by inflammation in the synovium, the lining of the membranes that surround the joints. This chronic inflammation can lead to joint damage, pain, stiffness, and functional impairment.</p>
<p>RA is considered a systemic disease because it can affect multiple organ systems. RA is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management and support from healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Key aspects…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Common symptoms of RA include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which are often more pronounced in the morning or after periods of inactivity. RA typically affects joints on both sides of the body, such as the wrists, knees, and fingers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical evaluation, medical history, blood tests (e.g., rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-CCP antibodies), and imaging studies (e.g., X-rays or MRI).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment for RA aims to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, slow down joint damage, and improve the patient’s quality of life. Common treatments include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and biologic therapies. Lifestyle modifications, including physical therapy and exercise, are also important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Disease</strong>: In RA, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, primarily the synovium, causing inflammation. The exact cause of this autoimmune response is not fully understood, but it likely involves genetic and environmental factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Progressive Joint Damage</strong>: Over time, persistent inflammation can lead to joint damage and deformities. This joint damage can be irreversible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra-Articular Manifestations</strong>: RA can affect organs and systems outside the joints, leading to complications such as inflammation of the heart lining (pericarditis), lung disease, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lifestyle Factors</strong>: Adopting a healthy lifestyle is crucial in managing RA. This includes maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise to maintain joint flexibility and muscle strength, and managing stress. Smoking cessation is especially important because smoking is a risk factor for RA and can worsen the disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: The course of RA varies from person to person. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are associated with better outcomes. Some people with RA may experience periods of remission when the disease is less active, while others may have ongoing symptoms and joint damage.</p></li>
