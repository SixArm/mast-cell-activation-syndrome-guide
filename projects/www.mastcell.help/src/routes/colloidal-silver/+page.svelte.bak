<p>Colloidal silver is a suspension of tiny silver particles in a liquid, typically water. It has been used for centuries for its purported antimicrobial properties and has been marketed as a dietary supplement, topical remedy, and disinfectant. However, its safety and effectiveness are debated.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Antimicrobial Properties</strong>: Silver has long been known for its antimicrobial properties, and colloidal silver is believed to exert antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. It is thought to work by disrupting the cellular processes of microorganisms and inhibiting their growth and reproduction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uses</strong>: A dietary supplement for immune support and general health maintenance. Topical application for wound healing, skin infections, and skin conditions such as acne, eczema, or psoriasis. Nasal sprays or throat sprays for colds, flu, sinus infections, or sore throat. Eye drops or ear drops for infections or inflammation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety Concerns</strong>: Despite its historical use and anecdotal reports of benefits, colloidal silver poses several potential risks and safety concerns. Prolonged or excessive use of colloidal silver can lead to a condition called argyria. Colloidal silver can causes allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, kidney damage, or neurologic effects. Colloidal silver may interact with medications or other supplements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory Status</strong>: In many countries, including the United States, colloidal silver is not approved or regulated as a medication.</p></li>
