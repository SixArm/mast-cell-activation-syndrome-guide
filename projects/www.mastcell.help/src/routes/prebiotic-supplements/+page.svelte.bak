<h1 id="prebiotic-supplements">Prebiotic supplements</h1>
<p>Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike probiotics, which are live microorganisms, prebiotics are non-digestible fibers, carbohydrates, or compounds that serve as a food source for beneficial bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Common types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inulin and Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)</strong>: These are naturally occurring fibers found in certain fruits, vegetables, and plants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)</strong>: GOS are prebiotics found in certain legumes and dairy products.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lactulose</strong>: Lactulose is a synthetic sugar that is not fully absorbed in the small intestine. It reaches the colon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resistant Starch</strong>: Resistant starch resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon intact. Examples are green bananas and legumes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pectin</strong>: Pectin is a type of fiber found in fruits, particularly in peels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gut Health</strong>: A healthy balance of gut bacteria is associated with various benefits, including improved digestion, enhanced nutrient absorption, and a strengthened immune system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fermentation and Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production</strong>: Beneficial bacteria ferment prebiotics in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as byproducts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metabolism Support</strong>: Prebiotics may have a positive impact on metabolic health, including the regulation of blood sugar levels and lipid metabolism.</p></li>
</ul>
