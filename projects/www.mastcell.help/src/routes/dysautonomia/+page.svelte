<h1 id="dysautonomia">Dysautonomia</h1>
<p>Dysautonomia, also known as autonomic nervous system dysfunction or autonomic neuropathy, is a broad term used to describe a group of medical conditions that involve abnormalities or malfunctions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is responsible for regulating various involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, temperature control, and the body’s response to stress.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: May include pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathies, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), neurocardiogenic syncope, or familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: May include dizziness and lightheadedness, fainting or near-fainting episodes, fast heart rate (tachycardia) or slow heart rate (bradycardia), blood pressure changes, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, bloating, constipation), temperature regulation issues, vision problems, sleep disturbances, sweating abnormalities, fatigue, weakness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: May involve a thorough medical evaluation, <a href="/physical-examination/">physical examination</a>, autonomic function tests, and sometimes specialized testing like tilt-table tests or thermoregulatory sweat tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: May include lifestyle modifications (such as increasing fluid and salt intake), medications to manage symptoms (such as beta-blockers or medications to increase blood volume), physical therapy or exercise programs, biofeedback and relaxation techniques, dietary changes, and management of any underlying medical conditions contributing to the dysautonomia</p></li>
