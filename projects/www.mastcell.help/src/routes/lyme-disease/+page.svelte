<h1 id="lyme-disease">Lyme disease</h1>
<p>Lyme disease is an infectious illness caused by the bacterium
Borrelia burgdorferi. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the
bite of infected black-legged ticks, often referred to as deer ticks or
Ixodes scapularis ticks in North America. Lyme disease is prevalent in
North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Lyme disease is more easily treated in its early stages, so prompt
medical attention is essential. If you suspect you have been exposed to
ticks, consult a healthcare provider for evaluation, testing, and
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Early Symptoms</strong>: Lyme disease typically
progresses through stages. In the early stage, within 3 to 30 days after
a tick bite, individuals may experience flu-like symptoms, including
fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen
lymph nodes. A characteristic early sign is a circular, red rash with a
clear center that resembles a “bull’s-eye.” This rash is called erythema
migrans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Later Symptoms</strong>: If left untreated, the disease
can progress to later stages, with symptoms that may include severe
headaches, joint pain, heart palpitations, and neurological symptoms
like facial palsy and memory problems. These symptoms can occur weeks to
months after the initial infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complications</strong>: If Lyme disease is not treated,
it can lead to more serious complications, affecting the joints, heart,
and nervous system. This later stage is known as disseminated or late
Lyme disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: The diagnosis of Lyme disease is
often based on clinical symptoms and the patient’s history of possible
tick exposure. Laboratory tests, such as serology tests to detect
antibodies to the bacterium, can support the diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Lyme disease is treated with
antibiotics. Early treatment with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or
amoxicillin, is highly effective and usually results in a full recovery.
The choice of antibiotic and the duration of treatment depend on the
stage of the disease and individual factors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Preventing Lyme disease primarily
involves avoiding tick bites. This can be done by wearing long clothing,
using insect repellent, conducting tick checks after spending time
outdoors, and reducing tick populations around homes and recreational
areas.</p></li>
</ul>
