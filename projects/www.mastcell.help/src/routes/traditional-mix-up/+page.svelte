<h1 id="traditional-mix-up">Traditional mix-up</h1>
<p>The word “traditional” in medicine has a mix-up because it has at least two meanings in wide use, and the meanings are mostly opposite.</p>
<p>The word “traditional” can mean traditional in the sense of traditional indigenous treatments throughout history. Some examples of the term are “traditional Chinese medicine” and “traditional Egyptian herbalism” and “traditional Inuit oils”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traditional Chinese practices can use medicine such as <a href="/acupunture/">acupuncture</a> and derivatives such as <a href="/soliman-auricular-allergy-treatment/">Soliman Auricular Allergy Treatment</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional Egyptian practices can use herbs such as <a href="/khellin/">khellin</a> and derivatives such as <a href="/cromolyn-sodium/">cromolyn sodium</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional Inuit practices can use a <a href="/carnivore-diet/">carnivore diet</a> plentiful in fish oils and derivatives such as <a href="/omega-3/">omega-3</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The word “traditional” can mean traditional in the sense of allopathic medical training, such as currently taught at major worldwide medical schools such as Harvard in the United States and Imperial College in the United Kingdom. Some examples of the term are “traditional allopathic studies” and “traditional scientific methods” and “traditional medical licenses”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traditional allopathic studies are when medicine is taught at colleges and university through lectures, seminars, practicals. Focus is per topic, such as per organ e.g. the heart, or specialization e.g. cardiology, or treatment e.g. atorvastatins.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional scientific methods are when researchers make conjectures (i.e. hypothetical explanations), derive predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, then carry out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Traditional medical licenses are exemplified by the Medical Doctor (MD) license in the United States. The license is awarded based on a standardized examination exemplified by the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).</p></li>
</ul>
