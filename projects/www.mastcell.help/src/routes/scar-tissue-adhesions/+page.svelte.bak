<h1 id="scar-tissue-adhesions">Scar tissue adhesions</h1>
<p>Scar tissue adhesions refer to the abnormal connections or attachments that can form between adjacent tissues or organs during the healing process after an injury or surgery. Scarring is a natural part of the body’s response to tissue damage, and the formation of scar tissue helps to repair and strengthen injured areas.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Adhesions Formation</strong>: Adhesions occur when scar tissue extends beyond its normal boundaries and connects with nearby structures that it shouldn’t. Adhesions can form between layers of tissues, organs, or structures that are normally separate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: Common causes of scar tissue adhesions include surgical procedures, abdominal or pelvic surgeries, inflammation (such as from infections or autoimmune diseases), and trauma or injury.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Pain, restricted movement, or dysfunction of affected organs. For example, adhesions in the abdominal or pelvic area may cause pain during movement or interfere with the normal functioning of organs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complications</strong>: Adhesions can lead to complications, especially when they cause structures or organs to become stuck together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosing scar tissue adhesions often involves a combination of clinical evaluation, [medical history](../medical-history/) review, and imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scans, or MRI. In some cases, diagnostic laparoscopy may be performed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: May include physical therapy, massage, medications to manage pain and inflammation, or surgical intervention to release or remove adhesions.</p></li>
