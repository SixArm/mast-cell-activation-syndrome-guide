<p>A low-salicylate diet, sometimes called a low-salicylic acid diet, is
a dietary approach that restricts foods and beverages with high levels
of salicylates. Salicylates are naturally occurring chemicals found in
various plants and foods. Some individuals may have sensitivity or
intolerance to salicylates, which can lead to symptoms such as
headaches, skin rashes, digestive issues, and other discomfort. As a
result, they may choose to follow a low-salicylate diet to reduce their
exposure to these compounds.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Foods to choose</strong>: low-salicylate fruits
(e.g. pears, papayas, melons), Low-salicylate vegetables (e.g. carrots,
sweet potatoes, zucchini), lean proteins (e.g. chicken, turkey, fish),
dairy products (if tolerated), grains (e.g. rice, rice noodles, and
oatmeal), non-caffeinated beverages (e.g. water, herbal teas), oils, and
fats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foods to avoid</strong>: high-salicylate fruits and
vegetables, most spices and herbs, high-salicylate nuts (e.g. almonds,
peanuts), some grains (e.g. wheat, rye), caffeinated beverages
(e.g. coffee, black tea), alcohol, certain food additives, and processed
foods with artificial colors and flavors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Salicylates are found in a wide range of foods, including fruits
(especially berries, grapes, and citrus), vegetables (tomatoes, peppers,
and eggplants), spices, herbs (e.g., mint, oregano), some nuts, and
certain flavorings and food additives.</p>
<p>Salicylates are also found in non-food products, such as aspirin and
some skincare products.</p>
<p>Before starting a low-salicylate diet, it is advisable to consult
with a healthcare provider or dietitian. They can help determine whether
such a diet is appropriate for you, guide you on food choices, and
monitor your nutritional intake to prevent deficiencies. Additionally,
if you suspect that salicylates are causing health issues, it’s
essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis
and management plan.</p>
