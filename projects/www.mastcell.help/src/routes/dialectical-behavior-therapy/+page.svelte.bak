<p>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT). Dialectics refers to the acceptance of conflicting thoughts, feelings,
and behaviors as valid and the synthesis of these opposing elements to promote
change and growth.</p>
<p>DBT typically involves individual therapy sessions, group skills training
sessions, phone coaching between sessions, and consultation team meetings for
therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Emotion regulation</strong>: Learning to identify, understand, and manage intense
emotions in healthy and adaptive ways. This includes skills for tolerating
distress, reducing emotional vulnerability, and increasing emotional
resilience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpersonal effectiveness</strong>: Improving communication and relationship
skills to navigate interpersonal conflicts, set boundaries, and assertively
express needs and desires while maintaining self-respect and respect for
others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distress tolerance</strong>: Developing strategies for coping with distressing
situations without resorting to harmful or impulsive behaviors. This includes
learning to tolerate distressing emotions and situations without avoiding or
reacting impulsively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mindfulness</strong>: Cultivating present-moment awareness and non-judgmental
acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Mindfulness skills are
central to DBT and are used to enhance self-awareness, reduce reactivity, and
promote psychological well-being.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice</strong>: The comprehensive nature of DBT allows individuals to learn and
practice skills in various contexts and receive support from their therapist
and peers throughout the process.</p></li>
