<p>If you react to marshmallows, it’s probably gelatin that’s to blame. Gelatin is a protein and, although rare, it can lead to allergic reactions. You might experience hives, an itchy mouth or throat, mouth swelling, or stomach ache.</p>
<p>Gelatin is also found in gummy sweets.</p>
<p>Gelatin issues have been linked to vaccines such as the flu shot.</p>
