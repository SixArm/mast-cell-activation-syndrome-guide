<h1 id="kawasaki-disease">Kawasaki disease</h1>
<p>Kawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare but serious condition that primarily affects children under the age of 5. It causes inflammation in the walls of medium-sized arteries throughout the body, including the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart. The exact cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic factors, environmental triggers, and an abnormal immune response.</p>
<p>If untreated, Kawasaki disease can lead to complications, particularly affecting the coronary arteries, heart muscle, and heart valves.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: High fever persisting for at least five days, rash, bloodshot eyes (conjunctivitis), swollen red lips and tongue (strawberry tongue), swollen lymph nodes in the neck, redness and swelling of the hands and feet followed by peeling of the skin, irritability or fussiness, joint pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Perform blood tests, echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart), and other imaging studies to evaluate the heart and rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a solution of antibodies derived from donated blood, along with aspirin to reduce inflammation and prevent blood clots. Early treatment is important to reduce the risk of complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: Most children with Kawasaki disease recover completely with prompt treatment, although some may experience long-term complications, particularly if coronary artery abnormalities develop.</p></li>
