<p>White blood cells (WBCs), also known as leukocytes, are a crucial
component of the immune system and play a key role in defending the body
against infections and foreign invaders. They are produced in the bone
marrow and circulate throughout the bloodstream, where they can travel
to sites of infection and inflammation to combat pathogens.</p>
<p>Abnormal levels of white blood cells can provide important diagnostic
information and may indicate the presence of an underlying health issue.
For example, an elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) is often
seen in response to infections, while a low white blood cell count
(leukopenia) can be caused by various factors, including bone marrow
disorders, chemotherapy, or autoimmune conditions.</p>
<p>There are several types of white blood cells:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Neutrophils</strong>: Neutrophils are the most abundant
type of white blood cell and are often the first responders to
infection. They engulf and destroy bacteria and other
pathogens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lymphocytes</strong>: Lymphocytes are a diverse group of
white blood cells that include B cells and T cells. B cells produce
antibodies, which target and neutralize pathogens. T cells assist in the
immune response, directly attacking infected cells, and regulating the
immune system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monocytes</strong>: Monocytes are large white blood cells
that can transform into macrophages when they migrate into tissues.
Macrophages engulfing and break down pathogens and cellular
debris.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eosinophils</strong>: Eosinophils defend against
parasitic infections and are also involved in the immune response to
allergies, asthma, and certain autoimmune diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basophils</strong>: Basophils release histamine and other
chemicals that can trigger inflammation and allergic reactions. They
play a role in immediate hypersensitivity responses.</p></li>
</ul>
