<h1 id="l-arginine">L-arginine</h1>
<p>L-arginine is an amino acid that helps the body build protein, and also is an essential substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), creatine, polyamines, homoarginine, and agmatine in mammals (including humans). NO is a major vasodilator and increases blood flow to tissues.</p>
<p>Your body usually makes all the L-arginine it needs. L-arginine is also found in most protein-rich foods, including fish, red meat, poultry, soy, whole grains, beans and dairy products. As a supplement, L-arginine can be used orally and topically.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cardiovascular Health</strong>: L-arginine supplements may help improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, and enhance exercise performance, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease or hypertension.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wound Healing</strong>: L-arginine supplements may help wound healing by promoting collagen synthesis and immune function, particularly in individuals with impaired wound healing due to conditions such as diabetes or peripheral artery disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune Function</strong>: L-arginine supplements may improve immune responses in certain populations, such as older adults or individuals undergoing surgery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Athletic Performance</strong>: L-arginine supplements may enhance exercise performance and muscle growth. The theory is that increased nitric oxide production from L-arginine supplementation may improve blood flow to working muscles, thereby increasing nutrient delivery and oxygen uptake.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Erectile Dysfunction</strong>: L-arginine supplements may help with erectile dysfunction (ED), because nitric oxide plays a key role in the physiological process of penile erection by relaxing smooth muscle cells in the blood vessels of the penis, allowing for increased blood flow.</p></li>
