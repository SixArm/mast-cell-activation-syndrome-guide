<h1 id="vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-vip">Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)</h1>
<p>Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, including the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract, vascular system, and immune system.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Receptors</strong>: VIP receptors are present on various cell types, including smooth muscle cells, immune cells, and glandular cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gastrointestinal Effects</strong>: In the gastrointestinal tract, VIP has several effects, including the relaxation of smooth muscle, stimulation of secretion from glands, and modulation of nutrient absorption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vasodilation</strong>: VIP acts as a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes blood vessels, leading to an increase in blood flow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Effects</strong>: VIP has immunomodulatory properties, influencing the activity of immune cells. It can suppress inflammation and enhance anti-inflammatory responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neurotransmitter Function</strong>: VIP acts as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system. It is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep-wake cycles, and various neuroendocrine functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VIPoma</strong>: In rare cases, tumors called VIPomas can develop, leading to excessive production of VIP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Therapeutic Applications</strong>: VIP, and synthetic analogs such as CirsVIP, have been potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and septic shock.</p></li>
