<p>The FAILSAFE diet is a dietary approach aimed at identifying and managing food sensitivities. The term “FAILSAFE” stands for “Free of Additives, Low in Salicylates, Amines, and Flavor Enhancers”. Also known as the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) Elimination Diet.</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Free of Additives</strong>: This refers to avoiding foods containing artificial additives such as preservatives, colorings, and flavorings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low in Salicylates</strong>: Salicylates are natural chemicals found in certain foods, including fruits, vegetables, spices, and some medications. Some individuals may be sensitive to salicylates, experiencing symptoms like headaches, skin rashes, or behavioral changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low in Amines</strong>: Amines are compounds found in various foods, particularly aged and fermented foods like cheese, wine, and aged meats. Like salicylates, some people may have sensitivities to amines, experiencing symptoms like headaches, digestive issues, or mood changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low in Flavor Enhancers</strong>: This involves avoiding foods containing certain flavor enhancers, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), which can trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The FAILSAFE diet typically involves an initial strict elimination phase where all potentially problematic foods are removed from the diet. After a period of symptom relief, individual foods are systematically reintroduced to identify which ones trigger symptoms. This process helps individuals identify their specific food sensitivities and develop a personalized dietary plan.</p>
