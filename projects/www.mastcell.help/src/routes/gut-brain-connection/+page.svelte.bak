<h1 id="gut-brain-connection">Gut-brain connection</h1>
<p>The gut-brain connection refers to the bidirectional interaction between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (the gut) and the brain, such as via the nervous system, the immune system, and the endocrine system.</p>
<p>Gut problems are implicated in mental health conditions such as stress and depression. Mental problems are implicated in gut health conditions such as stomachaches and bloating.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enteric Nervous System (ENS)</strong>: The ENS, often referred to as the “second brain,” is a complex network of neurons that lines the GI tract. It plays a crucial role in controlling digestive functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vagus Nerve</strong>: The vagus nerve is a major part of the autonomic nervous system and serves as a key communication link between the gut and the brain. It carries signals in both directions, allowing the brain to influence gut function and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis</strong>: The gut is home to a diverse community of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiota. The microbiota can influence the gut-brain axis through the production of bioactive compounds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune System</strong>: The gut houses a significant portion of the body’s immune cells. Immune responses in the gut can influence inflammation and immune activity in the brain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormones</strong>: Hormones produced in the gut, such as ghrelin and leptin, can influence appetite and energy balance, sending signals to the brain about hunger and satiety.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health</strong>: Maintaining a healthy gut through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management may contribute to a positive gut-brain connection, and help digestive health and mental health.</p></li>
