<p>If you’re going to the doctor, or work in healthcare, you can bring your own protective gloves.
Here’s why…</p>
<p>Many protective gloves can cause allergic reactions and/or mast cell reactions. Many doctors and nurses have switched from gloves made of latex, which is a big allergen, to gloves made of nitrile, which is synthetic rubber. This helps, but not enough for all mast cell disorder patients.</p>
<p>The problem: many nitrile gloves are manufactured with ” accelerators” which speed up the manufacturing process. These accelerators are chemicals which can turn up as residues on the gloves, and can cause contact dermatitis and also delayed reactions. Many healthcare workers are unaware of this.</p>
<p>If you want to protect yourself, then buy yourself a pack of accelerator-free gloves, and try them on yourself to ensure they are reaction-free for you personally.</p>
<p>Also ask your healthcare providers to always use accelerator-free gloves when treating you. This helps keep you safe, and also helps educate your healthcare team.</p>
