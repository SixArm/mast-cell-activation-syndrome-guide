Mastocytosis (ISM)</h1>
<p>Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (ISM) is a rare and chronic medical
condition characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in various
organs throughout the body, including the skin, bone marrow,
gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Mast cells are a type of immune cell
that plays a role in the bodyâ€™s response to allergens and inflammatory
triggers. In ISM, these mast cells are abnormally activated and can
release excessive amounts of chemical substances, such as histamine,
which can lead to a range of symptoms.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symptoms: ISM can lead to a wide array of symptoms, which may
vary from person to person. Common symptoms include skin flushing,
itching, hives, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and, in some cases,
anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic responses).</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnosis: The diagnosis of ISM is based on clinical symptoms,
physical examination findings, and the detection of an abnormally high
number of mast cells in various tissues, typically confirmed through a
bone marrow biopsy. Blood tests can also be used to assess serum
tryptase levels, which are often elevated in ISM.</p></li>
<li><p>Classification: ISM is classified as one of the subtypes of
systemic mastocytosis, which is a group of rare disorders characterized
by the abnormal proliferation of mast cells. ISM is considered a milder
and more stable form compared to other systemic mastocytosis
subtypes.</p></li>
<li><p>Triggers: Various factors or triggers, such as physical exertion,
stress, temperature changes, or certain foods, can activate mast cells
in individuals with ISM, leading to symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Treatment: The management of ISM primarily involves the control
of symptoms and the prevention of mast cell activation. This may include
the use of antihistamines, medications to stabilize mast cells (e.g.,
cromolyn sodium), and the avoidance of known triggers. In some cases,
corticosteroids or other medications may be prescribed to manage severe
symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Prognosis: ISM generally follows a relatively stable and indolent
(slow-growing) course. While it can be associated with bothersome
symptoms, it does not typically progress to a more aggressive form of
systemic mastocytosis. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is
essential for managing symptoms and monitoring the condition.</p></li>
