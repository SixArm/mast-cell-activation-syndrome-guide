<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine, which is a type of signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system and inflammation. IL-6 is produced by various cells, including immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and it has diverse functions in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inflammatory Response:</strong> IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, meaning it is involved in promoting inflammation. It is released in response to infections, tissue injuries, and other inflammatory stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acute Phase Response:</strong> IL-6 is a key mediator of the acute phase response, which is the bodyâ€™s immediate and early response to inflammation. It stimulates the liver to produce proteins involved in inflammation, tissue repair, and the immune response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic Inflammation:</strong> Elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions. In these conditions, IL-6 contributes to persistent inflammation and tissue damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cardiovascular Health:</strong> Elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Role in Cancer:</strong> IL-6 is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival. In some cases, elevated levels of IL-6 are observed in cancer, and it may contribute to tumor progression.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Therapeutic Target:</strong> Due to its involvement in inflammation and various diseases, IL-6 has become a therapeutic target for certain conditions. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-6 or its receptor are used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> IL-6 levels can be measured through blood tests. Elevated levels may indicate inflammation or certain medical conditions.</p></li>
