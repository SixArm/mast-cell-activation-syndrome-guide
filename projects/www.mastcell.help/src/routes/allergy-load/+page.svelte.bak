<h1 id="allergy-load">Allergy load</h1>
<p>The term “allergy load” (a.k.a. “total allergen load”) refers to the cumulative
exposure to allergens that an individual experiences in their environment. When
the allergy load exceeds a person’s capacity (a.k.a. “total allergen
threshold”), the the person can have allergic reactions, exacerbation of
allergic symptoms, or even development of new allergies.</p>
<p>Managing allergy load involves identifying and minimizing exposure to
allergens through various strategies, including allergen avoidance,
environmental control measures, dietary modifications, and allergen
immunotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Key factors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environmental Exposures</strong>: Examples: pollen, mold, mites, dander, perfume, volatile organic compounds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dietary Exposures</strong>: Examples: dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, shellfish.
Cross-reactivity between allergens may occur, further increasing the total
allergen load.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact Exposures</strong>: Examples: cleaners, detergents, makeup, lotions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Occupational Exposures</strong>: Examples: chemicals, dust, fumes, latex, pesticide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capacity Factors</strong>: Genetic predisposition, immune system function, and
individual susceptibility to allergens can influence an individual’s allergy
load capacity and their likelihood of developing allergic diseases</p></li>
</ul>
