<h1 id="functional-medicine-gotoit-framework">Functional medicine GOTOIT framework</h1>
<p>The functional medicine GOTOIT framework provides a systematic way to assess and address an individual’s health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>The acronym “GOTOIT” stands for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1. Gather</strong>: Gather relevant information about the patient’s health history, family history, lifestyle, exposures, and symptoms. This may include an intake interview, review of medical records, physical exams, or laboratory tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2. Organize</strong>: Organize data into a structured format to identify patterns, connections, and areas of concern. This may involve using tools such as the Functional Medicine Matrix to prioritize the patient’s health issues and underlying imbalances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3. Tell the story</strong>: Create a comprehensive narrative or “story” that integrates the information. Clarify the patient’s health goals, concerns, and priorities, as well as the underlying factors contributing to their health challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4. Outcome goals</strong>: Establish outcome goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Goals are the patient’s desired improvements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>5. Interventions</strong>: Implement interventions to improve health. These may include dietary changes, lifestyle changes, stress management techniques, physical activity, and mind-body therapies, among others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>6. Track</strong>: Track the treatment over time to assess effectiveness, adjust interventions as needed, and achieve desired outcomes. This may involve follow-up visits, reassessments, and ongoing collaboration.</p></li>
