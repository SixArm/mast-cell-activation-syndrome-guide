<h1 id="brain-fog">Brain fog</h1>
<p>“Brain fog” is a colloquial term used to describe a set of symptoms
related to cognitive function and mental clarity. It is not a medical
diagnosis, but rather a subjective description of one’s mental state.
People experiencing brain fog often report feeling mentally cloudy,
confused, forgetful, and unable to concentrate or think clearly. The
term is frequently used to express a lack of mental sharpness or
focus.</p>
<p>If you experience persistent or severe brain fog, it’s essential to
consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause
and receive appropriate guidance or treatment. Management of brain fog
often involves addressing the root causes. Lifestyle changes, such as
improving sleep, managing stress, staying hydrated, and maintaining a
balanced diet, can be beneficial. In some cases, medical treatment may
help.</p>
<p>Common factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sleep Deprivation</strong>: A lack of quality sleep can

anxiety can affect mental clarity and lead to mental fog.</p></li>
