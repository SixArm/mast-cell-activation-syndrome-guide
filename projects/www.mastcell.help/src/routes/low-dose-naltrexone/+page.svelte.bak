<p>Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) may be a novel anti-inflammatory agent in the central nervous system, via action on microglial cells. Effects appear to be entirely independent from naltrexone’s better-known activity on opioid receptors.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immune Modulation:</strong> LDN is believed to exert its effects by influencing the release of certain neurotransmitters and modulating the activity of immune cells. It may enhance the production of endorphins, which are natural opioids produced by the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cytokine Modulation:</strong> LDN has been suggested to influence the levels of cytokines, which are signaling molecules involved in the immune response. Some studies propose that LDN may reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote anti-inflammatory cytokines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions with Inflammatory Components:</strong> LDN has been explored in conditions with underlying inflammatory components, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic pain conditions, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Diseases:</strong> Some studies and anecdotal reports suggest that LDN may be beneficial in certain autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn’s disease. The potential anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to the observed improvements in symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic Pain:</strong> Chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia, are characterized by inflammation and altered pain processing. LDN has been investigated for its potential role in reducing inflammation and modulating pain perception.</p></li>
