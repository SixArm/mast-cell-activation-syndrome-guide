<h1 id="bradycardia">Bradycardia</h1>
<p>Bradycardia means an abnormally slow heart rate, typically a resting heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute (BPM) in adults.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Normal Physiological Variations</strong>: A heart rate below 60 BPM may be normal, especially in well-trained athletes, or during deep sleep, or older people.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medications</strong>: Some medications, particularly those used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions, can slow the heart rate as a side effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heart Block</strong>: This is a condition where the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked as they move through the heart’s electrical system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sick Sinus Syndrome</strong>: This is a disorder of the heart’s electrical system that can cause the heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or irregularly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vagal Stimulation</strong>: The vagus nerve, which plays a role in regulating heart rate, can be stimulated by factors such as vomiting, straining during bowel movements, or carotid sinus massage, leading to bradycardia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Underlying Medical Conditions</strong>: Certain medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, electrolyte imbalances, and infections affecting the heart, can lead to bradycardia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: dizziness, fatigue, weakness, fainting (syncope), shortness of breath, chest pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Medications such as antiarrhythmics or heart stimulators. A pacemaker implant may help. Lifestyle changes involve staying well-hydrated and avoiding alcohol and caffeine.</p></li>
