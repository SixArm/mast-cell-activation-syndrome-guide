<h1 id="trigger-cleaning">Trigger cleaning</h1>
<p>Trigger cleaning refers to a set of cleaning practices and measures aimed at reducing or eliminating allergens and irritants from the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clean Well</strong>: Dust, vacuum, and wipe surfaces. Use hypoallergenic cleaners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remove Dust</strong>: Use damp cloths or electrostatic dusters, to help prevent dispersion of dust into the air.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vacuum</strong>: Ideally use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to trap small particles, including allergens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wash Well</strong>: Wash all linens, bedding, and curtains in hot water and hypoallergenic detergent to kill dust mites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protect Beds</strong>: Consider using allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers to reduce exposure to dust mites and their allergens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Purifiers</strong>: Use an air purifier, ideally with a HEPA filter, ideally with an activated carbon filer. If outdoor air has triggers, then keep your windows closed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pet Allergens</strong>: Groom pets to reduce shedding. Use allergen-reducing pet shampoos. Designate pet-free zones in the home, especially in bedrooms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevent Mold</strong>: Address moisture issues to prevent mold growth. Use dehumidifiers in damp areas. Ensure good ventilation. Remove visible mold using cleaning solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask Professionals</strong>: Hire help for specialized cleaning, such as carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, and mold remediation.</p></li>
