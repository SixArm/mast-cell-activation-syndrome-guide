<h1 id="endometriosis">Endometriosis</h1>
<p>Endometriosis is a medical condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This tissue, called endometrial implants, may grow on organs in the pelvic and abdominal areas. Endometriosis is a chronic condition that can cause pain and may lead to fertility issues.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, which may vary in intensity. Other symptoms include infertility, painful menstrual periods, painful sexual intercourse, painful bowel movements, or urination during menstruation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Definitive diagnosis is typically made through laparoscopic surgery, during which the doctor can visually confirm the presence of endometrial implants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: The exact cause of endometriosis is not well understood. Retrograde menstruation, where menstrual blood flows backward into the pelvic cavity, is one theory. Genetic factors, immune system dysfunction, and hormonal influences may also play a role.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pain Management</strong>: Pain management is a key aspect of treating endometriosis. Over-the-counter pain relievers, hormonal medications (such as birth control pills or hormonal IUDs), and certain surgical interventions may be used to alleviate symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormonal Treatment</strong>: Hormonal therapy is often used to control the growth of endometrial tissue. This may include hormonal birth control methods, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, or progestin therapy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surgical Options</strong>: Laparoscopic surgery can be performed to remove endometrial implants and scar tissue. In some cases, a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) may be recommended.</p></li>
