<h1 id="dysbiosis">Dysbiosis</h1>
<p>Dysbiosis refers to an imbalance or disruption in the normal microbial community (microbiota) that resides in and on the body, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gut Microbiota</strong>: The human gut is home to a complex and diverse community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes. This microbiota plays a crucial role in various physiological functions, such as digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system regulation, and protection against pathogens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imbalance in Composition</strong>: Dysbiosis occurs when there is an imbalance in the types and proportions of microorganisms in the gut. This can involve a reduction in beneficial bacteria (commensals) and an overgrowth of potentially harmful microorganisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Causes of Dysbiosis</strong>: Antibiotics can affect beneficial microbes and harmful microbes. Diets high in processed foods, or low in fiber, cann harm the microbiota. Psychological stress has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiota. Gastrointestinal illness can lead to dysbiosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequences of Dysbiosis</strong>: Dysbiosis can contribute to digestive problems, harm immune functions, increase systemic inflammation, and affect metabolic disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management and Treatment</strong>: Dietary changes, prebiotics (substances that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria), probiotics (beneficial bacteria supplements). In some cases, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can restore a healthy microbiota.</p></li>
</ul>
