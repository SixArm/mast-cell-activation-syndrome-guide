<p>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to visualize the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. It utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create detailed images of the biliary and pancreatic systems without the need for contrast material or invasive procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: MRCP is primarily used to evaluate the biliary system, assess pancreatic ducts, and detect abnormalities such as pancreatic duct strictures, stones, or tumors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: In most cases, no special preparation is required for MRCP. Patients may be asked to fast for a few hours before the procedure to minimize motion artifacts from bowel movements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advantages</strong>: MRCP does not require the insertion of contrast material or invasive procedures such as endoscopy or surgery. MRCP provides high-resolution images that allow for detailed evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic systems. Unlike other imaging techniques such as CT scan or fluoroscopy, MRCP does not expose patients to ionizing radiation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations</strong>: While MRCP provides detailed anatomical images, it does not provide functional information about the biliary or pancreatic system.</p></li>
</ul>
