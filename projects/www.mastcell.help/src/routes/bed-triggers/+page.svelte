<h1 id="bed-triggers">Bed triggers</h1>
<p>Bed triggers can include any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pillows</strong>: Pillow and pillowcases are the #1 source of bed triggers for many people. Pillows and pillowcases can accumulate irritants such as dust, oils such as from your skin, particles from the air such as airborne pollen, airborne spores, or airborne chemicals. Try doing laundry at least every week in extra-hot water with hypoallergenic laundry detergent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dust mites</strong>: Dust mites are microscopic scavengers that feed on dead human skin cells, and can cause allergies and reactions. Dust mites can live inside bedding, pillows, and mattresses, as well as in carpets and rugs. Try washing your bedding and pillows at least every week in extra-hot water with hypoallergenic laundry detergent. Try replacing your pillows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latex</strong>: Many mattresses and some pillows contain latex, which is a significant allergen that can cause serious reactions in sensitive people. Try checking your mattress and pillows to see if they contain latex. Try getting an allergy test for latex. If your mattress or pillows contain latex, and youâ€™re allergic to latex, then replace them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detergents</strong>: Some laundry detergents may be triggers, due to allergens, fragrances, dyes, or chemicals. Try switching to a fragrance-free, dye-free, hypoallergenic detergent for washing. If you typically use bleach, or fabric softeners, or anti-static dryer sheets, then try eliminating these for a month.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pets</strong>: Pets that come into the bedroom can bring in many potential triggers, especially if the pets also go outside, and especially if the pets have any kind of chemical treatments such as flea and tick spray. Try keeping your pets out of your bedroom for 3 weeks to see if your symptoms improve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clutter</strong>: Too much clutter in your bedroom can accumulate dust and allergens. Try simplifying your bedroom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try trigger elimination, an easy way is to sleep in a different room for a few nights, ideally on an air mattress, with different bedding, different pillows, and with an air filter.</p>
