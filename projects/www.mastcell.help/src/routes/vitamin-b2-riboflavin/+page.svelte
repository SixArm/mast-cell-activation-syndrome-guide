<p>Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, is one of the water-soluble
B-vitamins that play essential roles in various metabolic processes in
the body. It is necessary for maintaining good health and is involved in
several bodily functions. Here are some key aspects of vitamin B2
(riboflavin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Energy Metabolism: Riboflavin is a coenzyme involved in energy
metabolism. It works in conjunction with other enzymes to help convert
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the
body’s primary source of energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Cellular Growth and Repair: Riboflavin is important for normal
cell growth and function, including the repair and maintenance of
various tissues.</p></li>
<li><p>Antioxidant Activity: Riboflavin is part of the antioxidant
system in the body. It helps protect cells from oxidative stress by
participating in the regeneration of other antioxidants like
glutathione.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy Skin and Vision: Adequate riboflavin intake is necessary
for maintaining healthy skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. It also
contributes to good vision.</p></li>
<li><p>Red Blood Cell Production: Riboflavin plays a role in the
formation of red blood cells.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dietary sources of riboflavin include dairy products, lean meats,
poultry, fish, eggs, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and enriched
cereals. Like other B-vitamins, riboflavin is water-soluble, meaning the
body does not store it for long periods, so it needs to be regularly
obtained from the diet.</p>
<p>Riboflavin deficiency is relatively rare in well-balanced diets, but
it can occur, leading to symptoms such as inflamed, red, and sore
throat, chapped and cracked lips, and inflammation and redness of the
lining of the mouth and tongue. It can also result in a condition called
ariboflavinosis. To prevent deficiency, it’s important to consume a
variety of foods that provide riboflavin as part of a healthy diet.</p>
