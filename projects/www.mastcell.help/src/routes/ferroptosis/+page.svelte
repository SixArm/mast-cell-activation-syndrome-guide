<h1 id="ferroptosis">Ferroptosis</h1>
<p>Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, characterized by the
iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides that ultimately lead to
cell membrane damage and cell death. It is different from other forms of
cell death, such as apoptosis and necrosis, and has gained attention in
the field of cell biology and medicine for its potential role in various
diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and
ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>
<p>Researchers are exploring the potential for therapeutic interventions
that can modulate ferroptosis to treat these conditions. This includes
the development of drugs that target specific pathways involved in
ferroptosis, such as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation or iron chelators
to reduce iron availability.</p>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lipid Peroxidation: Ferroptosis involves the oxidative damage of
lipids, specifically the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in
cell membranes. This process generates toxic lipid molecules known as
lipid peroxides.</p></li>
<li><p>Iron Dependence: Iron plays a crucial role in ferroptosis. The
presence of iron promotes the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) that contribute to lipid peroxidation and ultimately cell
damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Glutathione Depletion: Glutathione is an important antioxidant
that helps protect cells from oxidative stress. In ferroptosis, there is
a depletion of glutathione, which reduces the cellâ€™s ability to
neutralize ROS and protect against lipid peroxidation.</p></li>
<li><p>Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4): GPX4 is an enzyme that plays a
key role in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In ferroptosis,
GPX4 activity is inhibited or reduced, contributing to the accumulation
of lipid peroxides.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhibition of System Xc-: System Xc- is a cellular transporter
that imports cystine (a precursor to glutathione) into cells in exchange
for glutamate. Inhibiting this system can reduce the availability of
cystine and glutathione, further promoting ferroptosis.</p></li>
</ul>
