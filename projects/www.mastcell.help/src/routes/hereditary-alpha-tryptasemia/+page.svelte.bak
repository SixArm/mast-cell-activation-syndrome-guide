<p>Hereditary Alpha-Tryptasemia (HαT) is a genetic condition characterized by elevated levels of alpha-tryptase in the blood. Alpha-tryptase is a protein produced by mast cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response, particularly in allergic and inflammatory reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Basis</strong>: Most people have two copies of the TPSAB1 gene (one from each parent), but individuals with HαT can have more copies, which results in elevated alpha-tryptase levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevalence</strong>: HαT is considered a relatively common genetic condition, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of around 5-10%.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Unexplained fatigue, generalized pain, skin flushing, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms can be non-specific and may overlap with other medical conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: HαT is typically diagnosed through blood tests that measure alpha-tryptase levels. A diagnosis of HαT is made when an individual has elevated baseline alpha-tryptase levels on multiple occasions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: For individuals with HαT who are experiencing symptoms, management may involve addressing specific symptoms or underlying conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Association with Other Conditions</strong>: HαT has been associated with an increased risk of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Testing</strong>: Genetic testing for HαT typically involves analyzing the number of TPSAB1 gene copies to confirm the diagnosis.</p></li>
