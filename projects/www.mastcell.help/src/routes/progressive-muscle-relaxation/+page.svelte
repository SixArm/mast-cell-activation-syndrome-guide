<p>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a relaxation technique. It involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups to induce a state of physical and mental relaxation. PMR is often used as a stress management and relaxation tool and is helpful for individuals dealing with anxiety, tension, or sleep difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Key steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get Comfortable</strong>: Find a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed. Sit in a comfortable chair or lie down on your back.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deep Breathing</strong>: Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your lungs to fill with air. Exhale slowly through your mouth, releasing tension as you breathe out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Progressive Muscle Tension and Relaxation</strong>: Begin with a specific muscle group, usually starting with your toes and working your way up through different muscle groups in your body. The sequence is often as follows: toes, feet, calves, thighs, hips, buttocks, abdomen, back, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, throat, face (including jaw, forehead, and eyes).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tense the Muscles</strong>: Focus on one muscle group at a time. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, intentionally tense the muscles in that specific group for about 5-10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release and Relax</strong>: Suddenly release the tension in that muscle group as you exhale. Focus on the sensation of relaxation and notice the contrast between tension and relaxation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pause</strong>: Take a few moments of rest between muscle groups. Breathe naturally and allow yourself to experience the relaxation before moving on to the next muscle group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General Relaxation</strong>: Once you’ve completed the entire sequence, take a few moments to enjoy the overall sense of relaxation throughout your body.</p></li>
</ul>
