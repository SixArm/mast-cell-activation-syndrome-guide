<h1 id="heart-rate-variability-monitor">Heart rate variability monitor</h1>
<p>A heart rate variability (HRV) monitor is a device used to measure the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, reflecting the body’s autonomic nervous system activity. It’s a key indicator of the balance between the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) branches of the nervous system.</p>
<p>HRV monitors typically utilize sensors such as chest straps, wristbands, or fingertip sensors to detect the electrical signals produced by the heart. These signals are then analyzed to determine the variability in the intervals between heartbeats.</p>
<p>Higher HRV is associated with a relaxed state. Lower HRV may indicate stress or fatigue. Fitness enthusiasts and athletes also use HRV monitoring to track changes in fitness levels over time and optimize training routines.</p>
<p>Changes in HRV can be indicative of heart disease, diabetes, autonomic nervous system disorders, and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. By tracking HRV, individuals and healthcare providers can monitor changes in emotional well-being and response to treatment.</p>
<p>HRV monitors come in various forms, including wearable devices, mobile apps, and dedicated monitors.</p>
