<h1 id="imatinib">Imatinib</h1>
<p>Imatinib is a medication used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. It belongs to a class of drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Imatinib works by blocking the activity of specific proteins known as tyrosine kinases, which are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Brand name: Glivec.</p>
<p>Imatinib is most commonly used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a type of tumor that occurs in the digestive tract. It may also be used in the treatment of other types of cancer, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD).</p>
<p>By inhibiting the activity of tyrosine kinases, imatinib helps to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells and may lead to tumor shrinkage or stabilization. It is often taken orally in the form of tablets or capsules.</p>
<p>Common side effects of imatinib may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, fatigue, rash, and fluid retention. More serious side effects, such as liver problems, low blood cell counts, and heart problems, can occur but are less common.</p>
<p>Imatinib has been a significant advancement in the treatment of certain types of cancer and has improved outcomes for many patients. However, itâ€™s essential to use imatinib under the supervision of a healthcare provider and to discuss any potential side effects or concerns with them. Additionally, regular monitoring may be necessary during treatment with imatinib to assess its effectiveness and detect any adverse effects.</p>
