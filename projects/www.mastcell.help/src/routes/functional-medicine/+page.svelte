<h1 id="functional-medicine">Functional medicine</h1>
<p>Functional medicine is an approach to healthcare that focuses on
understanding the root causes of illness and treating the whole person,
rather than just addressing specific symptoms or diseases.</p>
<p>Functional medicine practitioners aim to identify and address the
underlying imbalances in the body that contribute to disease or
discomfort. By treating the root causes, rather than just the symptoms,
they seek to improve overall health and well-being.</p>
<p>Key aspects…</p>

integrated system, considering the interactions between various organs
and systems, and among all aspects of a person’s life, including

potential health issues before they become more serious.</p></li>
