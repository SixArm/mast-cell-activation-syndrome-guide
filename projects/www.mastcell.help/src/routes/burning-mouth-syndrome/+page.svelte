<h1 id="burning-mouth-syndrome-bms">Burning mouth syndrome (BMS)</h1>
<p>Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a complex and often painful condition characterized by a burning sensation in the mouth, typically on the tongue, lips, palate, or throughout the entire oral cavity. This condition can also be referred to as “glossodynia”, “stomatodynia”, or “oral dysesthesia”. BMS is a chronic condition that can persist for months or even years.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that BMS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other possible causes of oral discomfort and burning sensations must be ruled out before a diagnosis of BMS is made.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<p>Symptoms: The primary symptom of BMS is a burning, scalding, or tingling sensation in the mouth. Some individuals may also experience other oral discomforts, such as dry mouth, altered taste (dysgeusia), or a metallic taste.</p>
<p>Location: The burning sensation can affect various areas of the oral cavity, including the tongue, lips, palate, gums, and throat. It may also involve multiple areas simultaneously.</p>
<p>Triggered by Eating: Symptoms may worsen or be triggered by eating or drinking, especially hot, spicy, or acidic foods and beverages.</p>
<p>Diverse Population: BMS can affect people of all ages and genders, but it is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women.</p>
<p>Causes: The exact cause of BMS is not well understood, and it can be challenging to pinpoint a single underlying cause. Potential factors include nerve damage, hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, oral habits, medications, allergies, and psychological factors.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Diagnosis of BMS is often based on the characteristic symptoms and exclusion of other possible causes of oral discomfort. It may require a comprehensive evaluation by an oral healthcare provider, including a dentist or oral medicine specialist.</p>
<p>Treatment: The treatment of BMS can be challenging, as it often involves addressing the underlying cause, if identified. Treatment may include: oral medications (such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or anti-anxiety medications) and oral rinses to relieve pain and dry mouth.</p>
<p>Managing Underlying Conditions: If BMS is related to other medical conditions, treating those conditions may alleviate the symptoms.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Changes: Avoiding known triggers, staying hydrated, and practicing good oral hygiene.</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary Approach: BMS may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare providers from different specialties, including dentists, oral medicine specialists, neurologists, and mental health professionals.</p>
