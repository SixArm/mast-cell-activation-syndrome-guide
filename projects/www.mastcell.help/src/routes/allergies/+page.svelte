<h1 id="allergies">Allergies</h1>
<p>Allergies are exaggerated or hypersensitive immune responses to
substances that are typically harmless to most people. These substances,
known as allergens, can trigger an immune reaction in individuals who
are allergic to them.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Common Allergens: Pollen, dust mites, animal dander, insect
stings, certain foods (e.g., peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy,
shellfish), medications (e.g., antibiotics, aspirin), latex, and
more.</p></li>
<li><p>Immune Response: When an allergic person is exposed to an
allergen, their immune system recognizes it as a threat and produces
antibodies, such as IgE (immunoglobulin E), specific to that
allergen.</p></li>
<li><p>Common Symptoms: Sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery
eyes, skin rashes, hives, swelling, coughing, wheezing, shortness of
breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Anaphylaxis: This is a severe and potentially-fatal reaction that
can involve symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat,
a drop in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness. Seek immediate
emergency help.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnosis: Allergies are often diagnosed through a combination of
medical history, physical examination, and specific tests, such as skin
prick tests and blood tests, which can help identify allergens
triggering the symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Treatment: The primary treatment for allergies involves avoiding
the allergen whenever possible. Medications can relieve allergy
symptoms. These may include antihistamines, decongestants,
corticosteroids, immunotherapies, and adrenaline for severe
reactions.</p></li>
</ul>
