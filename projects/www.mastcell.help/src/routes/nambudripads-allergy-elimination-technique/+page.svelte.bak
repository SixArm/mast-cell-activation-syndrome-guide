<p>Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique (NAET) is a holistic therapy developed by Dr. Devi Nambudripad in the 1980s. It is based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture, chiropractic techniques, kinesiology, and nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Goal</strong>: The goal of NAET treatments is to reprogram the body’s response to the allergen or intolerance, allowing the body to tolerate the substance without triggering an allergic reaction or sensitivity. The treatment process is individualized and may require multiple sessions to address all identified allergens or sensitivities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Theory</strong>: According to NAET theory, allergies and sensitivities are caused by disruptions or blockages in the flow of the body’s energy, known as qi (pronounced “chee”). Symptoms manifest when the body comes into contact with allergens or intolerant substances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protocol</strong>: The NAET protocol involves a series of treatments that aim to desensitize the body to specific allergens or intolerances. The process typically begins with muscle testing or applied kinesiology to identify allergens or intolerances. Once the allergens are identified, a series of acupressure or acupuncture techniques are used to stimulate specific acupuncture points along the body’s meridians while the patient is in contact with the allergen.</p></li>
