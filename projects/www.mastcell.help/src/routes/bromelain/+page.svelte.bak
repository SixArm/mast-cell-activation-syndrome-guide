<h1 id="bromelain">Bromelain</h1>
<p>Bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes found in the pineapple plant (Ananas comosus). It is commonly used as a dietary supplement for its health benefits, including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and digestive properties. People with allergies to pineapple should avoid bromelain.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anti-inflammatory effects</strong>: Bromelain may inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation. It may alleviate symptoms of conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digestive support</strong>: Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme, meaning it helps break down proteins. It may facilitate the breakdown of proteins in the digestive tract, which may help improve digestion and nutrient absorption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pain relief</strong>: Bromelain may reduce pain and swelling associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, sports injuries, and post-surgical recovery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune support</strong>: Bromelain modulates the immune response by affecting the activity of immune cells and cytokines. It may have potential benefits for immune function and response to infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>: While bromelain is generally considered safe for most people when taken in appropriate doses, it may cause side effects in some individuals, such as digestive upset, allergic reactions, and skin irritation. Additionally, bromelain may interfere with certain medications, such as blood thinners.</p></li>
