<h1 id="acupuncture">Acupuncture</h1>
<p>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that involves
the insertion of thin, sterile needles into specific points on the body.
It is used to stimulate these points and is thought to help alleviate
various health conditions and promote overall well-being. Acupuncture
has been practiced for thousands of years and is part of a broader
system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).</p>
<p>Key points…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Theory of Energy Flow</strong>: Acupuncture is based on
the concept of Qi (pronounced “chee”), which represents the body’s vital
energy. Acupuncture is believed to restore the balance of Qi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acupuncture Points</strong>: Acupuncture points, also
known as acupoints, are specific locations on the body where the needles
are inserted. These points are believed to correspond to different
organs and systems in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needle Insertion</strong>: Fine, sterile needles are
inserted into the acupoints to various depths, depending on the
condition being treated. The needles are typically left in place for a
short period, often around 20 to 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>: The precise mechanism by
which acupuncture works is still being studied. It is thought to
stimulate the body’s natural healing responses by affecting the nervous
system, promoting blood circulation, and releasing endorphins (natural
pain-relieving chemicals).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions Treated</strong>: Acupuncture is used to
address a wide range of health issues, including pain management (such
as back pain, headaches, and osteoarthritis), stress and anxiety
reduction, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and
conditions like allergies and asthma. It is also used in some cases for
fertility and reproductive health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety and Sterility</strong>: Acupuncture is generally
considered safe when performed by trained and licensed practitioners
using sterile needles. In many countries, including the United States,
acupuncturists must adhere to strict hygiene and safety
standards.</p></li>
</ul>
