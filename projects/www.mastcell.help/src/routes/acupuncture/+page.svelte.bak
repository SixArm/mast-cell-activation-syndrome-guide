<h1 id="acupuncture">Acupuncture</h1>
<p>Acupuncture is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practice that involves the insertion of thin, sterile needles into specific points on the body. It can help alleviate various health conditions and promote overall well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Theory of Energy Flow:</strong> Acupuncture is based on the concept of Qi (pronounced “chee”), which represents the body’s vital energy. Acupuncture is believed to restore the balance of Qi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acupuncture Points:</strong> Acupuncture points, also known as acupoints, are specific locations on the body where the needles are inserted. These points are believed to correspond to different organs and systems in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Needle Insertion:</strong> Fine, sterile needles are inserted into the acupoints to various depths, depending on the condition being treated. The needles are typically left in place for a short period, often around 20 to 30 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Acupuncture is thought to stimulate the body’s natural healing responses by affecting the nervous system, promoting blood circulation, and releasing endorphins (natural pain-relieving chemicals).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions Treated:</strong> Acupuncture can help pain management (such as back pain, headaches, and osteoarthritis), stress reduction, nausea associated with chemotherapy, allergies and asthma, and fertility and reproductive health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety and Sterility:</strong> Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by trained practitioners. In many countries, acupuncturists must be licensed and must adhere to safety standards.</p></li>
