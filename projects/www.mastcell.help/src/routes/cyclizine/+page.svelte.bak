<p>Cyclizine is a medication used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness, as well as some histamine symptoms. Brand names: Emoquil, Marzine, Valoid.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uses</strong>: Cyclizine prevents and treats motion sickness, and also manages nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo, inner ear disorders, and chemotherapy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Cyclizine blocks H1 histamine receptors in the brain, thereby reducing the signals that trigger nausea and vomiting. It also has some anticholinergic properties, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter involved in nausea and vomiting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precautions</strong>: Cyclizine should be used with caution in certain populations, including individuals with a history of allergic reactions to antihistamines, glaucoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, or bowel obstruction. It may also interact with other medications, such as sedatives, tranquilizers, and certain antidepressants. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult with a healthcare professional before taking cyclizine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactions</strong>: Cyclizine may interact with other medications, including central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids, leading to increased sedation and drowsiness. It may also enhance the effects of anticholinergic drugs, leading to an increased risk of side effects such as dry mouth and constipation.</p></li>
