<h1 id="glutathione">Glutathione</h1>
<p>Glutathione is one of the body’s primary antioxidants. It helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. This role is vital for maintaining cellular integrity and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Detoxification</strong>: Glutathione plays a central role in the body’s detoxification processes, particularly in the liver. It binds to and helps remove various toxins, drugs, and heavy metals, aiding in their elimination from the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune Function</strong>: Glutathione is essential for the immune system. It helps regulate the production of white blood cells and plays a role in modulating the immune response to infections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance of Redox Balance</strong>: Glutathione helps maintain the balance between oxidized and reduced molecules within cells. This redox balance is crucial for normal cellular function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection of DNA</strong>: Glutathione helps protect the DNA in cells from damage caused by oxidation and other forms of stress. This is essential for the prevention of mutations and cancer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy Production</strong>: Glutathione is involved in the synthesis and repair of DNA and protein, both of which are critical for energy production and overall cellular health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin Health</strong>: Glutathione is sometimes used in cosmetic and skin care products for its potential skin-lightening effects and its role in maintaining skin health.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of glutathione in the body is synthesized within cells. Glutathione can also be obtained from dietary sources (such as fruits, vegetables, and some animal products), or from supplements. Supplements may have limited bioavailability, and their effectiveness is a topic of ongoing research. In some cases, healthcare providers may recommend other compounds, such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), to support glutathione levels indirectly.</p>
