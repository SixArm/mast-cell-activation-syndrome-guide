<p>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) refers to a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands, leading to an imbalance in the production of certain hormones.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Types</strong>: Classic CAH is severe and can result in a life-threatening condition in newborns if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Non-Classic CAH is milder with later-onset symptoms presenting in childhood or adolescence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Common symptoms include: ambiguous genitalia in females (in severe cases), excessive hair growth (hirsutism), irregular menstrual periods, rapid growth in childhood, salt-wasting and dehydration (in severe cases).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Newborns are often screened for CAH as part of routine newborn screening. Diagnosis involves measuring hormone levels in blood and urine and genetic testing to identify the specific enzyme deficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment aims to replace the deficient hormones and manage symptoms. It may include corticosteroid medications to replace cortisol, or ineralocorticoid medications to replace aldosterone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Lifelong treatment is typically required. Psychosocial support may be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Counseling</strong>: Genetic counseling may be recommended for families with a history of CAH to assess the risk of passing the condition to future generations.</p></li>
