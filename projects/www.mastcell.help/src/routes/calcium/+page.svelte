<h1 id="calcium">Calcium</h1>
<p>Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various
physiological functions in the body, including bone health, muscle
function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Importance: Calcium is vital for the development and maintenance
of strong bones and teeth, and for normal blood clotting, muscle
function, and nerve signaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Dietary Sources: Calcium-rich foods include dairy products, leafy
green vegetables, fortified foods, and certain seafood such as sardines
and salmon with bones.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for adults: 1,000 to 1,200
milligrams per day.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplement Forms: Calcium supplements are available in various
forms, including calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium gluconate,
and calcium lactate. The choice of form may depend on factors like
absorption and tolerance. For example, calcium citrate is often
recommended for individuals with reduced stomach acid or those taking
acid-reducing medications.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential Side Effects: Excessive calcium intake, either from
dietary sources or supplements, can lead to hypercalcemia, a condition
characterized by symptoms like kidney stones, constipation, and impaired
absorption of other minerals. It is important not to exceed recommended
intake levels.</p></li>
