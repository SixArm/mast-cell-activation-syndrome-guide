<h1 id="fecal-microbiota-transplantation-fmt">Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)</h1>
<p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), commonly known as fecal transplant, is a medical procedure in which fecal matter is collected from a healthy donor and transferred to the gastrointestinal tract of an ill recipient. The goal of FMT is to introduce a diverse community of beneficial microorganisms (microbiota) to improving gut health.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> FMT can be performed through different routes, including colonoscopy, nasogastric or nasoenteric tube, or capsules containing frozen or freeze-dried fecal material. The choice of route depends on the specific condition being treated and clinical considerations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Donor Screening:</strong> Donors undergo thorough screening to ensure they are healthy and have a diverse and balanced gut microbiota. Donor stool is carefully processed and tested for infectious agents before use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> Ongoing research is exploring the potential use of FMT in addressing other medical conditions associated with dysbiosis (imbalances in the gut microbiota), such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and certain metabolic disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety Considerations:</strong> While FMT has shown success in certain cases, safety considerations are essential. Risks include the potential transmission of infections or unknown pathogens. Strict donor screening and standardized protocols aim to minimize these risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory Status:</strong> In some regions, FMT is regulated as an experimental or investigational procedure. However, it has gained recognition as a standard treatment for recurrent CDI in certain cases.</p></li>
