<h1 id="low-allergen-diet">Low-allergen diet</h1>
<p>A low-allergen diet, often referred to as a hypoallergenic diet, is a
dietary approach that aims to reduce or eliminate foods and ingredients
that commonly trigger allergic reactions or food sensitivities. This
type of diet is typically used to manage or diagnose food allergies,
food intolerances, or conditions like eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic
dermatitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. A low-allergen diet focuses on
minimizing exposure to known allergenic or highly allergenic foods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foods to choose: most fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh
meats, non-dairy milk, gluten-free grains, most herbs and spices, and
most cooking oils.</p></li>
<li><p>Foods to avoid: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish,
shellfish, casein, lactose, gluten, artificial additives and
preservatives, and foods that are likely to be
cross-contaminated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A low-allergen diet can be restrictive, and it may not be suitable
for everyone. If you suspect food allergies or intolerances, itâ€™s
essential to work with a healthcare provider or allergist for proper
evaluation and diagnosis. They can help you identify specific triggers,
conduct allergy testing if needed, and develop a dietary plan tailored
to your individual needs. Additionally, dietary restrictions should be
monitored to ensure you still receive essential nutrients and to address
any potential nutrient deficiencies.</p>
