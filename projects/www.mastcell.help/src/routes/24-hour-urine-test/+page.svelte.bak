<h1 id="hour-urine-test">24-hour urine test</h1>
<p>A 24-hour urine test is a diagnostic procedure used to measure various substances excreted in urine over a 24-hour period. It can provide valuable information about kidney function, electrolyte balance, and other aspects of health.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Steps</strong>: The patient collects all urine produced over a 24-hour period. Usually, the process starts with an empty bladder, and all urine thereafter is collected, including the first morning urine the next day. Urine is stored in a container provided by the healthcare provider, and kept in a refrigerator to prevent bacterial growth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The laboratory analyzes the urine sample to measure various substances such as creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), protein, hormones, and other markers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Results are interpreted by healthcare providers in the context of the patientâ€™s [medical history](../medical-history/) and symptoms. Abnormal levels of certain substances may indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other health issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tests may include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>N-methyl histamine</p></li>
<li><p>2,3-Dinor-11beta-prostaglandin F2 alpha level</p></li>
