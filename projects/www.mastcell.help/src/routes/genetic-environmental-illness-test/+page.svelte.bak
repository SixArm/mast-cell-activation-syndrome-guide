<p>Genetic Environmental Illness (GENIE) test is a genetic susceptibility test used in the context of biotoxin-related illnesses. This type of test aims to identify genetic factors that may make individuals more susceptible to the effects of biotoxins, potentially leading to conditions like Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS).</p>
<p>GENIE analyzes “173 Genes found differentially expressed in CIRS patients are grouped into categories to better identify areas of pathophysiology. Not all CIRS patients are alike. This panel will allow providers to identify specific target areas for treatment from a diverse array of molecular pathways found in CIRS.”</p>
<p>If you are considering any specific test or treatment related to CIRS or biotoxin-related illnesses, it’s crucial to do so under the guidance of healthcare professionals who specialize in this area. Mold-related illnesses and their management can be complex, and a comprehensive approach is often needed for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</p>
