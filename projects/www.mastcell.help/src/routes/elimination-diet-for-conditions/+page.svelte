conditions</h1>
<p>The purpose of an elimination diet can vary, and it is often used to
identify and manage the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Food Allergies</strong>: For individuals with known or
suspected food allergies, an elimination diet can help identify specific
allergens and eliminate them from the diet to prevent allergic
reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food Sensitivities</strong>: Some individuals may
experience symptoms, such as digestive issues, headaches, or skin
problems, as a result of food sensitivities. An elimination diet can
help pinpoint the trigger foods and alleviate these symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Diseases</strong>: In autoimmune diseases like
celiac disease or Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, certain dietary
modifications, including elimination of gluten or specific foods, may
help manage the condition and reduce symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gastrointestinal Disorders</strong>: An elimination diet
can be used in the management of gastrointestinal disorders like
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to
identify trigger foods and reduce digestive symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behavioral Issues</strong>: In some cases, behavioral
problems in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), may be linked to dietary factors. An elimination diet can help
identify and manage foods that may exacerbate these issues.</p></li>
</ul>
