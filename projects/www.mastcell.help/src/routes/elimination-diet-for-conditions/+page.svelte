conditions</h1>
<p>The purpose of an elimination diet can vary, and it is often used to
identify and manage the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Food Allergies: For individuals with known or suspected food
allergies, an elimination diet can help identify specific allergens and
eliminate them from the diet to prevent allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Food Sensitivities: Some individuals may experience symptoms,
such as digestive issues, headaches, or skin problems, as a result of
food sensitivities. An elimination diet can help pinpoint the trigger
foods and alleviate these symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Autoimmune Diseases: In autoimmune diseases like celiac disease
or Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, certain dietary modifications, including
elimination of gluten or specific foods, may help manage the condition
and reduce symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Gastrointestinal Disorders: An elimination diet can be used in
the management of gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to identify trigger
foods and reduce digestive symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Behavioral Issues: In some cases, behavioral problems in
children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may
be linked to dietary factors. An elimination diet can help identify and
manage foods that may exacerbate these issues.</p></li>
</ul>
