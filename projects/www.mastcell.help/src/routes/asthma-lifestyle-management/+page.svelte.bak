<p><a href="../asthma/">Asthma</a> lifestyle management means you can adjust your daily activities to help improve your condition.</p>
<p><strong>Key steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Identify and Avoiding Triggers</strong>: Knowing and avoiding your asthma triggers can help reduce symptoms. Common triggers include allergens, irritants, cold air, exercise, and stress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allergen Management</strong>: Reducing exposure to allergens, such as dust mites, pet dander, and pollen, can help prevent asthma symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smoking Cessation</strong>: If you smoke, quitting is essential. Smoking exacerbates asthma symptoms and damages the lungs.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Stress Management</strong>: Managing stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and other stress-reduction methods can help control asthma symptoms.</p></li>
