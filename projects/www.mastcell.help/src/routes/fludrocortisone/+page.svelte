<h1 id="fludrocortisone">Fludrocortisone</h1>
<p>Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid medication that is used for its mineralocorticoid properties.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: It is a synthetic analog of aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It primarily exerts its effects on mineralocorticoid receptors, regulating electrolyte and fluid balance in the body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indications</strong>: It is primarily used in conditions where increased levels of aldosterone are needed. It is often prescribed for <a href="/adrenal-insufficiency/">adrenal insufficiency</a> and <a href="/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia/">Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)</a></p>
<p><strong>Mineralocorticoid Effects</strong>: The mineralocorticoid effects of fludrocortisone include promoting sodium retention and potassium excretion, helping to maintain blood pressure and electrolyte balance.</p>
<p><strong>Administration</strong>: The dosage is individual dependent. It is usually taken orally as a tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: May include fluid retention, swelling, increased blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalances. Prolonged use or high doses may lead to other corticosteroid-related side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Discontinuation</strong>: Do not to stop taking fludrocortisone suddenly, as this can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Changes in dosage should be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider.</p>
