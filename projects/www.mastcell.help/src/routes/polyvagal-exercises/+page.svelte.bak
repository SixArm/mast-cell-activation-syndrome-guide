<h1 id="polyvagal-exercises">Polyvagal exercises</h1>
<p>Polyvagal exercises are activities to influence the functioning of the the polyvagal system and autonomic nervous system. The aim is to promote a sense of safety, social connection, and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Some exercises</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Breathing Exercises</strong>: Engage in slow diaphragmatic breathing with long exhales, to stimulate the vagus nerve long exhales to promote relaxation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vocal Toning</strong>: Use gentle vocalizations, humming, or chanting. The vibrations from vocalizations can stimulate the vagus nerve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Face and Neck Stretches</strong>: Gently stretch and release tension in the muscles of the face and neck, which are connected to the vagus nerve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Engagement</strong>: Engage in positive social interactions, whether in person or virtually. Meaningful connections with others can activate the ventral vagal complex.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques</strong>: Practice mindfulness and grounding exercises to bring attention to the present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gargling</strong>: Gargling with water may stimulate the vagus nerve, as it involves the muscles connected to the vagus nerve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Laughter and Play</strong>: Engage in activities that bring joy. Positive emotions can activate the ventral vagal complex.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Exercise</strong>: Regular physical activity, especially activities like yoga, improves vagal tone and well-being.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Soothing Touch</strong>: Gentle self-soothing touch, such as placing a hand on your chest or abdomen, can promote a sense of comfort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)</strong>: Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups, promoting overall relaxation.</p></li>
</ul>
