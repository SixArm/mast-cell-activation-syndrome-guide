<p>Allergens, irritants, and toxins are terms used to describe substances that can have adverse effects on human health. While they are related concepts, there are distinctions in their definitions and the ways they impact the body. The distinctions can be helpful when discussing health conditions, exposures to substances, and symptom triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Allergens</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: Allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction in individuals with <a href="../allergies/">allergies</a>: the immune system reacts to these substances, leading to symptoms such as sneezing, itching, hives, or more severe reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Pollen, pet dander, mold spores, certain foods (e.g., nuts, shellfish), insect venom, and certain medications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Irritants</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: Irritants are substances that can cause irritation or inflammation of tissues upon contact. Irritation is a non-specific response and does not necessarily involve the immune system. The effects can be immediate and are not exclusive to individuals with allergies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Household cleaning chemicals, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and certain industrial chemicals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toxins</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: Toxins are substances produced by living organisms (biotoxins) or created synthetically (man-made toxins) that can cause harm to the body. Toxins can affect various organs and systems and may have acute or chronic effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>: <a href="../biotoxins/">Biotoxins</a> produced by bacteria, fungi, or plants (e.g., bacterial toxins, mycotoxins, plant toxins), as well as man-made toxins such as certain chemicals and pollutants.</p></li>
</ul>
