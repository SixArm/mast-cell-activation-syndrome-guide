<h1 id="antifungal-medications">Antifungal medications</h1>
<p>Antifungal medications are drugs used to treat fungal infections. Fungal infections can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, nails, hair, and internal organs. Antifungal medications work by targeting specific aspects of fungal cell structures or functions.</p>
<p><strong>Common classes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Azoles:</strong> Azoles are a broad class of medications that inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. Examples: fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polyenes:</strong> Polyenes work by binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. Examples: amphotericin B, nystatin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Echinocandins:</strong> Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall, causing fungal cell death. Examples: caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allylamines:</strong> Allylamines interfere with the synthesis of ergosterol, similar to azoles, but they target a different enzyme in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. Examples: terbinafine, naftifine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topical Antifungals:</strong> Topical antifungal medications are applied directly to the affected area (skin, nails, etc.). Examples: clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Griseofulvin:</strong> Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting fungal cell division. It is often used to treat dermatophyte infections, such as ringworm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flucytosine:</strong> Flucytosine is an antifungal agent that is used in combination with other antifungal drugs to treat systemic fungal infections, particularly those caused by Candida and Cryptococcus species.</p></li>
</ul>
