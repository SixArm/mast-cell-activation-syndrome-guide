<h1 id="antifungal-medications">Antifungal medications</h1>
<p>Antifungal medications are drugs used to treat fungal infections. Fungal infections can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, nails, hair, and internal organs. Antifungal medications work by targeting specific aspects of fungal cell structures or functions, inhibiting their growth and replication. There are different classes of antifungal drugs, and the choice of medication depends on the type and severity of the fungal infection. Here are some common classes of antifungal medications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Azoles</strong>: Azole antifungals are a broad class of medications that inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. Common azole antifungals include: Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, Voriconazole, Posaconazole.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polyenes</strong>: Polyene antifungals work by binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, leading to cell membrane damage and cell death. Common polyene antifungals include: Amphotericin B, Nystatin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Echinocandins</strong>: Echinocandins inhibit the synthesis of beta-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall. This disrupts the integrity of the cell wall and ultimately leads to fungal cell death. Common echinocandins include: Caspofungin, Micafungin, Anidulafungin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allylamines</strong>: Allylamines interfere with the synthesis of ergosterol, similar to azoles, but they target a different enzyme in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. Common allylamines include: Terbinafine, Naftifine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topical Antifungals</strong>: Topical antifungal medications are applied directly to the affected area (skin, nails, etc.). Common topical antifungals include: Clotrimazole, Miconazole, Terbinafine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Griseofulvin</strong>: Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting fungal cell division. It is often used to treat dermatophyte infections (such as ringworm).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flucytosine</strong>: Flucytosine is an antifungal agent that is used in combination with other antifungal drugs to treat systemic fungal infections, particularly those caused by Candida and Cryptococcus species.</p></li>
</ul>
