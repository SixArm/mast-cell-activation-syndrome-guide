<p>Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) is an approach to managing certain medical conditions, particularly Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). It is a structured and gradual exercise program to help individuals gradually increase their physical activity levels.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary goal is to improve a person’s physical function, to address the deconditioning and physical limitations associated with medical conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structure</strong>: GET involves a carefully planned and gradual increase in physical activity over time. It starts with activities that are well-tolerated and gradually progresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Individualized</strong>: GET is tailored to the individual’s specific abilities, taking into account their baseline fitness level, symptoms, and limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supervised or Self-Guided</strong>: GET can be supervised by a healthcare professional, such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, or it can be guided as a self-help program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pacing</strong>: GET involves finding a balance between activity and rest to prevent overexertion and a crash in symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controversy</strong>: GET has been a topic of controversy. Some patients report benefits, while others argue that it can exacerbate symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patient-Centered Care</strong>: Successful implementation of GET requires a patient-centered approach, taking into consideration the individual’s preferences, concerns, and feedback throughout the process.</p></li>
</ul>
