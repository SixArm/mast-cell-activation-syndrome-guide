<p>The primary treatment for MCAS involves medications like antihistamines and stabilizers. Some individuals also explore complementary and alternative therapies to help manage their symptoms. It’s essential to discuss these options with a healthcare provider and integrate them into a comprehensive treatment plan.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dietary changes:</strong> A low-histamine diet reduces histamine-rich foods, such as aged cheeses, fermented foods, and alcohol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nutritional supplements:</strong> Vitamin C acts as a natural antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. Quercetin is a flavonoid that can have anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing properties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probiotics:</strong> These can support gut health and balance the microbiome. However, the choice of probiotics should be made carefully, as some contain histamine-producing strains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stress reduction:</strong> Meditation, deep breathing, and biofeedback can help manage stress, which may exacerbate MCAS symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acupuncture:</strong> Some people find relief from symptoms through acupuncture, which may help rebalance the body’s energy flow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Herbal remedies:</strong> Butterbur is an herb that has been used for migraines and allergies and may have potential mast cell stabilizing effects. Stinging nettle have been used for allergies and may help reduce histamine-related symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental Changes:</strong> Minimize exposure to environmental allergens, pollutants, and irritants. This includes maintaining good indoor air quality.</p></li>
