<h1 id="histamine-psychosis">Histamine psychosis</h1>
<p>Histamine psychosis, also known as histaminergic psychosis, refers to a rare condition in which excessive levels of histamine in the body lead to the development of psychotic symptoms. Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of sleep, appetite, and mood. However, when histamine levels become dysregulated, it can result in abnormal neurological and psychiatric symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Causes</strong>: Histamine psychosis can occur due to various factors that lead to elevated histamine levels in the body. These may include histamine-rich foods, histamine-producing tumors, medications that interfere with histamine metabolism, and severe allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, agitation, disorganized thinking, and mood disturbances. These symptoms may resemble those seen in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Laboratory tests can measure histamine levels in the blood or urine and to identify any underlying medical conditions contributing to histamine dysregulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment of histamine psychosis focuses on addressing the underlying cause of histamine elevation and managing psychotic symptoms. Identify and avoid triggers. Try medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids. Develop coping strategies for managing symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: The prognosis for histamine psychosis depends on the underlying cause and the individualâ€™s response to treatment. In many cases, psychotic symptoms improve with appropriate management of histamine levels and treatment of underlying medical conditions.</p></li>
