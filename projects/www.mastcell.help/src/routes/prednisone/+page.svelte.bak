<p>Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as glucocorticoids. It is used to treat a variety of conditions due to its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>: Prednisone works by suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation in the body. It does this by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells and altering gene expression, leading to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators and the downregulation of the immune response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Prednisone is commonly prescribed to treat inflammatory conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis), allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus), dermatologic conditions (e.g., eczema, psoriasis), and certain types of cancer (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Prednisone can cause a wide range of side effects, particularly when used at higher doses or for prolonged periods. Common side effects may include increased appetite, weight gain, fluid retention, mood changes, insomnia, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as indigestion or stomach ulcers), elevated blood sugar levels, and increased susceptibility to infections. Long-term use of prednisone may also increase the risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, cataracts, glaucoma, and adrenal suppression.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Withdrawal</strong>: Abrupt discontinuation of prednisone after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, fever, headache, and nausea. To minimize the risk of withdrawal, prednisone is usually tapered gradually.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>: Prednisone is contraindicated in individuals with systemic fungal infections, untreated bacterial infections, and certain viral infections (such as herpes simplex or varicella-zoster). It should also be used with caution in individuals with diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, glaucoma, peptic ulcer disease, or psychiatric disorders.</p></li>
