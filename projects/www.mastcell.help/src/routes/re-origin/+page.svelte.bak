<p>The re-origin program is a science-based, self-directed neuroplasticity training program with a supportive community &amp; coaching designed for people suffering from anxiety, depression, long COVID, Lyme Disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and many other conditions.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the foundation of our brain retraining program at re-origin. This concept refers to the brain’s ability to change and adapt in response to new experiences and stimuli, allowing us to gradually shift the inflammatory processes that underpin a wide range of chronic conditions.</p>
<p>In the program, you work through 6 modules of virtual classes and practice 30 minutes per day of re-training exercises.You can join weekly group calls, group coaching, and virtual events to encourage you and keep you on track.</p>
<p>The course, coaching, and community support you to rewire your brain and feel like yourself again, all with scientifically-backed and proven methods that you can rely on to shift persistent symptoms.</p>
