<h1 id="allergy-shots">Allergy shots</h1>
<p>Allergy shots are a form of treatment for allergies. The shots drops
desensitize individuals to specific allergens, such as pollen, dust
mites, pet dander, and molds. Allergy shots are also known as
subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), and they are an alternative to
allergy drops, also known as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Desensitization</strong>: The primary goal of allergy
shots is to desensitize the immune system to specific allergens. Over
time, the immune system becomes less reactive to these allergens,
reducing the severity of allergic reactions when exposed to
them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administration</strong>: Allergy shots are administered
by a healthcare provider, typically an allergist or immunologist. The
treatment involves receiving injections of allergen extracts in
gradually increasing doses over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build-up Phase</strong>: The treatment usually begins
with a build-up phase, during which the injections are administered more
frequently (usually once or twice a week). The dose is gradually
increased to reach a maintenance level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance Phase</strong>: Once the maintenance dose is
reached, the frequency of injections is reduced (typically every 2-4
weeks). The maintenance phase can continue for several years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficacy</strong>: Allergy shots are effective in
reducing allergy symptoms in many patients. They can also help prevent
the development of new allergies or the worsening of existing
allergies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Treatment</strong>: Allergy shots are a
long-term treatment that typically continues for several years to
achieve lasting desensitization. The duration may vary from person to
person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety</strong>: Allergy shots are generally considered
safe. While local reactions (redness, swelling, itching at the injection
site) are common, severe adverse reactions are rare. The injections are
administered in a healthcare provider’s office where immediate medical
attention can be provided if needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age Group</strong>: Allergy shots are suitable for both
children and adults. They are often considered for children with
allergies who may not respond well to medications or who want to avoid
long-term medication use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: The level of effectiveness can
vary from person to person and depends on factors such as the specific
allergens and the individual’s immune response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance of Other Treatments</strong>: During the
build-up phase, some individuals may need to continue taking allergy
medications to manage symptoms. As the desensitization takes effect,
medication use can often be reduced.</p></li>
</ul>
