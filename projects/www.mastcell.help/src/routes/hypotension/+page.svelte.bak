<h1 id="hypotension">Hypotension</h1>
<p>Hypotension is a medical term used to describe low blood pressure, which is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries. While high blood pressure (hypertension) is a well-known health concern, low blood pressure can also have various implications for an individualâ€™s health and well-being.</p>
<p>Normal blood pressure typically falls within a range of 90/60 mm Hg to 120/80 mm Hg. Hypotension is generally defined as a blood pressure reading below 90/60 mm Hg.</p>
<p>Symptoms of hypotension may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>lightheadedness</li>
<li>fainting (syncope)</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>rapid or shallow breathing</li>
<li>cold or clammy skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment for hypotension depends on the underlying cause and the severity of symptoms. For mild cases, increasing fluid intake, particularly water and electrolyte-rich fluids, may be sufficient. In more severe cases or those with underlying medical conditions, healthcare professionals may recommend specific treatments.</p>
