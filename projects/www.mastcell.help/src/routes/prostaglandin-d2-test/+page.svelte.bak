<p>The Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) test is a diagnostic tool used to measure the levels of prostaglandin D2, a type of signaling molecule, in biological samples such as blood or urine. Elevated levels of PGD2 may indicate increased activity of mast cells, which are immune cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary purpose of measuring PGD2 is to assess the activation of mast cells. Mast cells release various mediators, including prostaglandins, during immune responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditions for Testing</strong>: PGD2 testing is often ordered when there is suspicion of mast cell disorders, particularly in cases where other mast cell mediators like tryptase are inconclusive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: Blood is typically drawn from a vein in the arm or, in the case of urine, collected over a specific period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Elevated levels of PGD2 may suggest increased mast cell activity. Like serum tryptase, the interpretation of PGD2 levels needs to be considered in context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variations</strong>: Providers may also consider evaluating other prostaglandins to get a more comprehensive picture of mast cell activity.</p></li>
