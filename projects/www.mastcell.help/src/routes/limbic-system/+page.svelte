<h1 id="limbic-system">Limbic system</h1>
<p>The limbic system is a complex network of structures in the brain that plays a central role in regulating emotions, motivation, learning, and memory. It is sometimes referred to as the “emotional brain” or the “emotional center” of the brain.</p>
<p><strong>Key components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Amygdala</strong>: This is a small almond-shaped structure deep within the brain. It is critical for processing and regulating emotions, particularly fear and the formation of emotional memories. The amygdala is involved in the body’s fight-or-flight response and can trigger fear and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hippocampus</strong>: This is essential for the formation of new memories and plays a role in spatial navigation. It helps consolidate information from short-term memory to long-term memory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothalamus</strong>: This is involved in regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and sleep. It also plays a central role in the release of hormones that control stress responses and the autonomic nervous system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thalamus</strong>: This serves as a relay station for sensory information between different parts of the brain. It plays a role in filtering and directing sensory input to various brain regions, including those in the limbic system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cingulate cortex</strong>: This is involved in emotional and cognitive processing. It plays a role in regulating autonomic functions, such as blood pressure and heart rate, in response to emotional stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Olfactory bulbs</strong>: These structures are associated with the sense of smell and are closely connected to the limbic system. Smell is strongly linked to emotional and memory processing.</p></li>
</ul>
