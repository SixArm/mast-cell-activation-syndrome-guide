<h1 id="sleep-hygiene">Sleep hygiene</h1>
<p>Sleep hygiene refers to a set of practices and habits that promote
good sleep quality and help individuals achieve restful and rejuvenating
sleep. Following these practices can improve your overall sleep
patterns, reduce the risk of sleep disturbances, and contribute to
better physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Some key principles…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule</strong>: Go to bed
and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency
helps regulate your body’s internal clock.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment</strong>: Ensure
your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Use blackout curtains, earplugs,
or a white noise machine if necessary. Invest in a comfortable mattress
and pillows that provide good support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Exposure to Screens</strong>: The blue light
emitted by phones, tablets, and computers can interfere with the
production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Avoid screens at least an
hour before bedtime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish a Bedtime Routine</strong>: Engage in calming
activities before bed, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or
practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Caffeine and Alcohol</strong>: Avoid caffeine and
alcohol in the hours leading up to bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep
patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Watch Your Diet</strong>: Large meals, spicy foods, and
excessive fluid intake close to bedtime can lead to discomfort and
wakefulness during the night. Try to finish eating at least two to three
hours before bed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get Regular Exercise</strong>: Engage in regular physical
activity, but avoid intense exercise close to bedtime. Exercise earlier
in the day can promote better sleep.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manage Stress</strong>: Chronic stress can disrupt sleep.
Practice stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation,
or yoga.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Naps</strong>: If you nap during the day, keep them
short (20-30 minutes) and earlier in the day to avoid interfering with
nighttime sleep.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mind What You Drink</strong>: Reduce your liquid intake
in the evening to minimize nighttime awakenings for trips to the
bathroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Exposure to Sunlight</strong>: Sunlight exposure
in the morning can help regulate your body’s sleep-wake cycle. Spend
time outdoors during daylight hours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Clock-Watching</strong>: Constantly checking the
time can increase stress and anxiety. If you can’t fall asleep, consider
getting out of bed and doing something relaxing until you feel
drowsy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the Bed Only for Sleep and Intimacy</strong>: Avoid
using your bed for activities like watching TV, working, or using
electronic devices. This helps train your brain to associate the bed
with sleep.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seek Professional Help When Needed</strong>: If you have
persistent sleep problems, consider consulting a healthcare provider or
sleep specialist for a proper evaluation and treatment.</p></li>
