<h1 id="sleep-hygiene">Sleep hygiene</h1>
<p>Sleep hygiene refers to a set of practices and habits that promote
good sleep quality and help individuals achieve restful and rejuvenating
sleep. Following these practices can improve your overall sleep
patterns, reduce the risk of sleep disturbances, and contribute to
better physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Some key principles…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Go to bed and wake up at
the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency helps regulate
your body’s internal clock.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment: Ensure your bedroom is
dark, quiet, and cool. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise
machine if necessary. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows that
provide good support.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit Exposure to Screens: The blue light emitted by phones,
tablets, and computers can interfere with the production of the sleep
hormone melatonin. Avoid screens at least an hour before
bedtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a Bedtime Routine: Engage in calming activities before
bed, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing relaxation
techniques like deep breathing.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit Caffeine and Alcohol: Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the
hours leading up to bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep
patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch Your Diet: Large meals, spicy foods, and excessive fluid
intake close to bedtime can lead to discomfort and wakefulness during
the night. Try to finish eating at least two to three hours before
bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Get Regular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity, but
avoid intense exercise close to bedtime. Exercise earlier in the day can
promote better sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage Stress: Chronic stress can disrupt sleep. Practice
stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, or
yoga.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit Naps: If you nap during the day, keep them short (20-30
minutes) and earlier in the day to avoid interfering with nighttime
sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Mind What You Drink: Reduce your liquid intake in the evening to
minimize nighttime awakenings for trips to the bathroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Control Exposure to Sunlight: Sunlight exposure in the morning
can help regulate your body’s sleep-wake cycle. Spend time outdoors
during daylight hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit Clock-Watching: Constantly checking the time can increase
stress and anxiety. If you can’t fall asleep, consider getting out of
bed and doing something relaxing until you feel drowsy.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Bed Only for Sleep and Intimacy: Avoid using your bed for
activities like watching TV, working, or using electronic devices. This
helps train your brain to associate the bed with sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Seek Professional Help When Needed: If you have persistent sleep
problems, consider consulting a healthcare provider or sleep specialist
for a proper evaluation and treatment.</p></li>
</ul>
