<h1 id="grape-seed-extract">Grape seed extract</h1>
<p>Grape seed extract is a dietary supplement derived from the seeds of grapes, particularly from red wine grapes (Vitis vinifera). It contains a variety of beneficial compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, and oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes (OPCs).</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Potent Antioxidants</strong>: It contains flavonoids and OPC which are potent antioxidants. Antioxidants help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, which are molecules that can cause oxidative damage to cells and contribute to chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and aging-related conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cardiovascular Health</strong>: It may improve circulation, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol levels. Also, the antioxidants may help protect against the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin Health</strong>: It may protect against UV radiation damage, reduce inflammation, and promote collagen synthesis, which may help improve skin elasticity, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, improve wound healing, and reduce the risk of scarring.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cognitive Function</strong>: It may have neuroprotective effects and may help support cognitive function. Animal studies have shown that grape seed extract supplementation may help improve memory and reduce cognitive decline associated with aging or neurodegenerative diseases. More research is needed to understand the potential effects of grape seed extract on cognitive health in humans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anti-inflammatory Effects</strong>: It may help reduce inflammation throughout the body. Chronic inflammation is believed to play a role in the development of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune conditions.</p></li>
