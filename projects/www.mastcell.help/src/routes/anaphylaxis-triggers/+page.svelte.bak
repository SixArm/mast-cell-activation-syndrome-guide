<li><p><strong>Insect Stings</strong>: Stings from bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause anaphylaxis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medications</strong>: Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and contrast media used in medical imaging, can trigger anaphylactic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latex</strong>: Exposure to latex, often found in gloves and medical equipment, can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals.</p></li>
