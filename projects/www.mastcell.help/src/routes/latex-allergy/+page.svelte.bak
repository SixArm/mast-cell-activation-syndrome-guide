<h1 id="latex-allergy">Latex allergy</h1>
<p>Latex allergy is an allergic reaction to latex, a natural rubber material derived from the sap of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Latex is commonly used in a wide range of products, including gloves, condoms, balloons, rubber bands, medical devices, and certain types of clothing and footwear. Individuals with latex allergy develop an immune response to proteins found in natural latex rubber, leading to allergic reactions upon exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Contact with latex or airborne latex particles can cause itching, redness, hives (urticaria), rash (contact dermatitis), sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing (shortness of breath), eye irritation, conjunctivitis (pink eye), or in rare cases life-threatening <a href="../anaphylaxis/">anaphylaxis</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk factors</strong>: Previous exposure to latex, particularly repeated or prolonged exposure, increases the risk of sensitization and development of latex allergy. Occupational exposure, such as for healthcare workers and laboratory technicians who frequently use latex gloves or come into contact with latex-containing products. Individuals with a history of other allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, or allergies to certain foods (such as bananas, avocados, kiwi, chestnuts, or tomatoes), may be at increased risk of latex allergy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Take precautions to avoid inhaling latex particles, such as avoiding areas where powdered latex gloves are used. Use latex-free gloves, medical devices, and other products whenever possible. Inform healthcare providers, dentists, and other caregivers about latex allergy to ensure appropriate precautions are taken during medical procedures or surgeries. Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace indicating latex allergy, particularly for individuals at risk of severe allergic reactions.</p></li>
