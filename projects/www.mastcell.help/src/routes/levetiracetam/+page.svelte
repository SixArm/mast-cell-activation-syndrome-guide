<h1 id="levetiracetam">Levetiracetam</h1>
<p>Levetiracetam is a medication primarily used to treat epilepsy. Levetiracetam belongs to a class of medications known as anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Brand name Keppra.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Levetiracetam is believed to work by stabilizing electrical activity in the brain. It does this by binding to a specific protein called synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), which is involved in the release of neurotransmitters. By binding to SV2A, levetiracetam helps regulate neurotransmitter release, which in turn helps prevent abnormal electrical activity and seizures in the brain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Levetiracetam is primarily used to treat epilepsy, including partial-onset seizures (also known as focal seizures) in adults and children over one month of age. It is also used as an adjunctive therapy (in combination with other AEDs) for myoclonic seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Common side effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, irritability, headache, and nausea. Serious side effects may include mood changes, depression, or suicidal thoughts. Itâ€™s important to report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety Considerations</strong>: Generally safe and well-tolerated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</strong>: The safety of levetiracetam during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or if you are breastfeeding, talk to your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of using levetiracetam.</p></li>
