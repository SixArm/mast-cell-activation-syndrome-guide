<h1 id="cholestyramine">Cholestyramine</h1>
<p>Cholestyramine is a medication classified as a bile acid sequestrant.
It is used to lower elevated levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)
cholesterol in the blood. Cholestyramine works by binding to bile acids
in the intestines, which reduces their reabsorption and promotes the
elimination of bile acids and cholesterol from the body. This, in turn,
leads to a reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>It’s important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop
a personalized treatment plan.</p>
<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine is primarily prescribed to individuals with high
cholesterol, specifically high LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>It is used as an adjunct to a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle
changes to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead, it acts
within the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>It binds to bile acids, which are needed for the digestion and
absorption of dietary fats.</p>
<p>The body compensates for the loss of bile acids by converting more
cholesterol into new bile acids. This process leads to a reduction in
circulating LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine is available as a powder and should be mixed with
water or another liquid before ingestion. It is taken orally.</p>
<p>The dose and frequency are determined by a healthcare provider based
on the individual’s cholesterol levels and response to treatment.</p>
<p>It is typically taken with meals to maximize its cholesterol-lowering
effects.</p>
<h3 id="effectiveness">Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine can significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels when
used as directed. It may also have a modest impact on reducing
triglyceride levels.</p>
<h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>
<p>Common side effects may include constipation, bloating, gas, and
stomach discomfort.</p>
<p>Cholestyramine may interfere with the absorption of certain
fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), so monitoring and supplementation of
these vitamins may be necessary.</p>
<p>It is important to drink plenty of fluids while taking cholestyramine
to help prevent constipation.</p>
<h3 id="interactions">Interactions</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine can interact with other medications, potentially
reducing their absorption. To prevent interactions, it is recommended to
take other medications at least one hour before or four to six hours
after taking cholestyramine.</p>
<h3 id="contraindications">Contraindications</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine should not be used in individuals with a history of
bowel obstructions or certain gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
<h3 id="duration-of-use">Duration of Use</h3>
<p>Cholestyramine is generally used as a long-term treatment, but the
duration of use is determined by the healthcare provider based on
individual needs and response to treatment.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<p>Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to monitor
cholesterol levels and assess the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
