<h1 id="hurting">Hurting</h1>
<p>“Hurting so so so deeply. And I am so so unsupported.”</p>
<p>“Being sick so much has really made me lose faith in so many human beings as so many people struggle with their empathy.”</p>
<p>“I’ve struggled with my health for ten years now and I’m at my wits end.”</p>
<p>“I’m so exhausted of having a totally uncontrolled illness and no idea what makes it flare. I just kept being told I have anxiety and need to go to therapy and drink more water.”</p>
<p>“Worrying over reactions every meal, exposure, malnutrition, debating how to handle living… I’m not sure how to cope with the uncertainty in anxiety, stress, or symptoms.”</p>
<p>“I was allergic to the medicine at the ER. I had my throat close, had a cardiac arrest, and died for several minutes.”</p>
<p>“This has been happening every night. I barely sleep. My body won’t shut down. I’m stuck in this dread state and my body feels weak. I get really hot and really cold. I have diarrhea and vomiting. I can’t take this anymore. It’s been 5 years and I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“It’s so upsetting and lonely. I dread when someone asks me how I am.”</p>
<p>“My faith in humanity is completely gone. The way I’ve been treated. The way I’ve seen other sick people, elderly folks, and human beings treated. I have no words.”</p>
<p>“I feel like a broken record that skips songs and sometimes randomly plays in reverse. It is nearly impossible for others to understand.”</p>
<p>“I can barely eat any food. I can hardly get out of bed. I’ve lost everything I own, including my pets.”</p>
<p>“The only thing that helps my flares now are handfuls of benzos which overall is not a solution.”</p>
<p>“I am currently praying for something to take me out the pain is so bad.”</p>
