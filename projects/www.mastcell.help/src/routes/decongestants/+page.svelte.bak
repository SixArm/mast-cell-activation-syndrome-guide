<h1 id="decongestants">Decongestants</h1>
<p>Decongestants are medications commonly used to relieve nasal congestion by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages. They are often used to alleviate symptoms associated with conditions such as the common cold, flu, sinusitis, or allergies.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Types</strong>: Oral decongestants are taken by mouth in the form of tablets or capsules. Topical decongestants are applied directly to the nasal passages in the form of nasal sprays or drops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Decongestants work by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion. This allows for improved airflow and relief from nasal stuffiness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Decongestants are often used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, sinusitis, or allergies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing</strong>: Oral decongestants are typically used for a limited duration (3-7 days) due to concerns about rebound congestion and potential side effects. Prolonged use of topical decongestant nasal sprays may also lead to rebound congestion and should be avoided for more than a few consecutive days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: May include increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. Topical decongestants may cause nasal dryness or irritation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contraindications</strong>: Decongestants may not be suitable for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or hyperthyroidism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactions</strong>: Decongestants can interact with certain medications, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and should be used with caution in combination with other sympathomimetic drugs.</p></li>
