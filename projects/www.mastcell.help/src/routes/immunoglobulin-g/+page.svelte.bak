<h1 id="immunoglobulin-g-igg">Immunoglobulin G (IgG)</h1>
<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most abundant class of antibodies found in the bloodstream and extracellular fluids. It plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response, providing defense against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Neutralization</strong>: IgG antibodies can neutralize pathogens by binding to them and blocking their ability to infect host cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opsonization</strong>: IgG antibodies can coat pathogens, marking them for destruction by phagocytes (such as macrophages and neutrophils) through a process called opsonization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Activation of Complement</strong>: IgG antibodies can activate the complement system, a group of proteins that enhances the immune response by promoting inflammation, attracting immune cells to the site of infection, and directly lysing pathogens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)</strong>: IgG antibodies can stimulate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells to recognize and destroy cells coated with antibodies, such as virus-infected cells or tumor cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Role in Immunity</strong>: IgG antibodies play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity. They provide long-lasting protection against pathogens by forming memory B cells, which can rapidly produce specific antibodies upon re-exposure to the same pathogen, leading to a faster and more effective immune response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Blood tests for IgG antibodies can assess immune function, detect past or current infections, and diagnose autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, the presence of specific IgG antibodies to a particular pathogen in the blood can indicate a previous exposure or vaccination.</p></li>
