<h1 id="carnivore-diet">Carnivore diet</h1>
<p>The carnivore diet is a type of diet that emphasizes the consumption of animal products exclusively and excludes plant-based foods. Individuals following the carnivore diet typically eat meat, fish, and other animal-derived foods while eliminating fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, and other plant-based foods.</p>
<p>Proponents of the carnivore diet suggest potential benefits such as improved energy levels, weight loss, and relief from certain health issues.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eat Animal Products</strong>: Focus on consumption of animal products, including red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy (if tolerated).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eat Fats and Proteins</strong>: Prioritize fatty cuts of meat to meet calorie energy needs, because the diet is low in carbohydrates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omit Plant Products</strong>: Exclude fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omit Processed Foods</strong>: Exclude processed foods, additives, and artificial ingredients.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nutrient Deficiency</strong>: Excluding plant foods can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, and phytonutrients found in fruits and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digestive Issues</strong>: Some individuals may experience digestive issues such as constipation due to the lack of fiber.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Health Risks</strong>: A carnivore diet lacks the diversity of nutrients found in a balanced diet. There are concerns about potential negative effects on heart health, kidney function, and other aspects of long-term health.</p></li>
