<h1 id="mast-cell-activation-syndrome-medications">Mast Cell Activation Syndrome medications</h1>
<p>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) treatments can use medications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Antihistamines</strong>: Non-sedating, second-generation antihistamines like cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), or fexofenadine (Allegra) are commonly used to block the effects of histamine and manage symptoms such as itching, flushing, and hives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mast Cell Stabilizers</strong>: Medications like cromolyn sodium (Gastrocrom) or ketotifen (Zaditor) can help stabilize mast cells and reduce their reactivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leukotriene Modifiers</strong>: Montelukast (Singulair) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that may be prescribed to manage respiratory and other symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)</strong>: PPIs like omeprazole (Prilosec) can help manage gastrointestinal symptoms by reducing stomach acid production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adrenaline Auto-Injector</strong>: Individuals with MCAS who are at risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be prescribed an adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine) auto-injector and trained on how to use it in case of an emergency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mast Cell Stabilizing Medications</strong>: In more severe cases of MCAS, medications like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib) or anti-IgE therapy (e.g., omalizumab) may be considered to manage symptoms and mast cell activation.</p></li>
</ul>
