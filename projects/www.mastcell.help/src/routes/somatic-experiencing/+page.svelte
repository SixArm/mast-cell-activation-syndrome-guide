<p>Somatic Experiencing (SE) is a therapeutic approach to heal trauma. This method focuses on the connection between the mind and body, recognizing the significance of the body’s physical sensations in the experience and resolution of trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trauma and the Nervous System:</strong> Traumatic experiences can lead to dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system. Healing involves addressing this dysregulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Titration:</strong> The therapy emphasizes “titration,” which means gradually exploring and processing traumatic memories or sensations in small, manageable doses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tracking Sensations:</strong> Clients are guided to track and pay attention to bodily sensations, to help feel and discharge pent-up energy associated with trauma.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pendulation:</strong> Pendulation involves moving back and forth between sensations of safety and comfort and those associated with stress or trauma, to help self-regulate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resourcing:</strong> Resourcing involves identifying and cultivating internal and external resources that can help individuals feel safe and supported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong> Techniques are employed to help clients stay grounded in the present moment, preventing them from becoming overwhelmed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attention:</strong> Mindfulness and breath awareness practices are integrated to help clients cultivate a greater sense of presence.</p></li>
</ul>
