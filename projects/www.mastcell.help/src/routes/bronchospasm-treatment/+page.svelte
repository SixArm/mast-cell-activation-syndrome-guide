<h1 id="bronchospasm-treatment">Bronchospasm treatment</h1>
<p>Treatment of bronchospasm typically involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bronchodilators: These medications, such as short-acting beta-2
agonists (e.g., albuterol) and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium), are
used to relax the airway smooth muscles and quickly relieve
bronchospasm. Long-acting bronchodilators may also be prescribed for
long-term management.</p></li>
<li><p>Anti-inflammatory Medications: In conditions like asthma,
corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) may be used to reduce airway
inflammation and prevent bronchospasm.</p></li>
<li><p>Allergen Avoidance: For individuals with allergic asthma,
identifying and avoiding allergens can help prevent
bronchospasm.</p></li>
<li><p>Lifestyle Modifications: Managing triggers such as
exercise-induced bronchospasm often involves warm-up exercises, using a
scarf to breathe in warm, moist air, and staying hydrated.</p></li>
<li><p>Oxygen Therapy: In severe cases, supplemental oxygen may be
required to ensure adequate oxygen levels in the blood.</p></li>
</ul>
