<h1 id="bronchospasm-treatment">Bronchospasm treatment</h1>
<p>Treatment of bronchospasm typically involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bronchodilators</strong>: These medications, such as short-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) and anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium), are used to relax the airway smooth muscles and quickly relieve bronchospasm. Long-acting bronchodilators may also be prescribed for long-term management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anti-inflammatory Medications</strong>: In conditions like asthma, corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) may be used to reduce airway inflammation and prevent bronchospasm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allergen Avoidance</strong>: For individuals with allergic asthma, identifying and avoiding allergens can help prevent bronchospasm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lifestyle Modifications</strong>: Managing triggers such as exercise-induced bronchospasm often involves warm-up exercises, using a scarf to breathe in warm, moist air, and staying hydrated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oxygen Therapy</strong>: In severe cases, supplemental oxygen may be required to ensure adequate oxygen levels in the blood.</p></li>
</ul>
