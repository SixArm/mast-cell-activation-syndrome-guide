<p>Diagnosing histamine intolerance can be challenging, as there are no specific tests to confirm the condition. It is typically diagnosed based on a personâ€™s [medical history](../medical-history/), symptoms, and the response to dietary modifications.</p>
<p>In some cases, healthcare providers may use a food diary to track symptom triggers and evaluate the response to a low-histamine diet.</p>
