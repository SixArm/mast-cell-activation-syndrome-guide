<h1 id="vitamin-c">Vitamin C</h1>
<p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. It is considered an essential nutrient, meaning that the human body cannot produce it on its own and must obtain it from dietary sources. Vitamin C has several important functions in the body, and it is well-known for its immune-boosting and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Antioxidant Properties</strong>: Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which means it helps protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants are essential for overall health and play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and age-related conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune Support</strong>: Vitamin C is often associated with immune system health. It helps stimulate the production of white blood cells, enhances the function of immune cells, and plays a role in the bodyâ€™s defense against infections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collagen Production</strong>: Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that plays a key role in wound healing, skin health, and the strength and structure of bones, cartilage, and connective tissues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absorption of Iron</strong>: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron (the type of iron found in plant-based foods) from the digestive tract. This is particularly important for individuals with iron-deficiency anemia.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neurotransmitter Synthesis</strong>: Vitamin C is involved in the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the brain), including serotonin and norepinephrine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin Health</strong>: Vitamin C is sometimes used in skincare products for its potential to promote healthy, radiant skin and reduce signs of aging.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dietary Sources</strong>: Vitamin C is found in a wide range of fruits and vegetables, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits), berries (strawberries, blueberries), kiwi, guava, papaya, red and green bell peppers, and broccoli.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficiency</strong>: Severe vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, a condition characterized by fatigue, swollen and bleeding gums, joint pain, and skin changes. Scurvy is rare in developed countries but can occur in individuals with limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)</strong>: The RDA for vitamin C varies by age, sex, and life stage but generally ranges from 65 to 90 milligrams per day for adults. The requirements are higher during pregnancy and lactation.</p></li>
