<h1 id="vitamin-c">Vitamin C</h1>
<p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin
that plays a crucial role in maintaining good health. It is considered
an essential nutrient, meaning that the human body cannot produce it on
its own and must obtain it from dietary sources. Vitamin C has several
important functions in the body, and it is well-known for its
immune-boosting and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Antioxidant Properties: Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which
means it helps protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free
radicals and reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants are essential for
overall health and play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases,
including heart disease, cancer, and age-related conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Immune Support: Vitamin C is often associated with immune system
health. It helps stimulate the production of white blood cells, enhances
the function of immune cells, and plays a role in the bodyâ€™s defense
against infections.</p></li>
<li><p>Collagen Production: Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of
collagen, a protein that plays a key role in wound healing, skin health,
and the strength and structure of bones, cartilage, and connective
tissues.</p></li>
<li><p>Absorption of Iron: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme
iron (the type of iron found in plant-based foods) from the digestive
tract. This is particularly important for individuals with
iron-deficiency anemia.</p></li>
<li><p>Neurotransmitter Synthesis: Vitamin C is involved in the
synthesis of certain neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the
brain), including serotonin and norepinephrine.</p></li>
<li><p>Skin Health: Vitamin C is sometimes used in skincare products for
its potential to promote healthy, radiant skin and reduce signs of
aging.</p></li>
<li><p>Dietary Sources: Vitamin C is found in a wide range of fruits and
vegetables, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits),
berries (strawberries, blueberries), kiwi, guava, papaya, red and green
bell peppers, and broccoli.</p></li>
<li><p>Deficiency: Severe vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, a
condition characterized by fatigue, swollen and bleeding gums, joint
pain, and skin changes. Scurvy is rare in developed countries but can
occur in individuals with limited access to fresh fruits and
vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The RDA for vitamin C varies
by age, sex, and life stage but generally ranges from 65 to 90
milligrams per day for adults. The requirements are higher during
pregnancy and lactation.</p></li>
