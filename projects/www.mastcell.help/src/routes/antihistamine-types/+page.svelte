<h1 id="antihistamine-types">Antihistamine types</h1>
<p>Antihistamines are available in two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First-generation antihistamines: These are older antihistamines,
such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine
(Chlor-Trimeton). They are effective but can cause drowsiness as a side
effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Second-generation antihistamines: These are newer medications,
such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), and fexofenadine
(Allegra). They are less likely to cause drowsiness and are often
preferred for daytime use.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Antihistamines are available in two main durations of action:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Short-acting antihistamines may need to be taken multiple times a
day.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-acting antihistamines provide relief for 24 hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Antihistamines are available in two main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Over the counter (OTC) which means you can buy them without a
prescription.</p></li>
<li><p>By prescription, typically for more severe allergic conditions or
for specific medical purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
