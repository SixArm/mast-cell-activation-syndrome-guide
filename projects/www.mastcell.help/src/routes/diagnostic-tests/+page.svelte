<h1 id="diagnostic-tests">Diagnostic tests</h1>
<p>Diagnostic tests are essential procedures used by healthcare providers to identify or confirm the presence of a disease or condition. These tests and a <a href="/physical-examination/">physical examination</a> guide treatment decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> These analyze samples of blood, urine, tissue, or other bodily fluids to measure levels of specific substances, detect the presence of infectious agents, or assess organ function. Common laboratory tests include <a href="/complete-blood-count/">complete blood count (CBC)</a>, blood chemistry panels, urinalysis, and microbiological cultures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imaging studies</strong>: These provide detailed images of internal structures and organs. Techniques such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are used to diagnose conditions affecting the bones, organs, soft tissues, and blood vessels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biopsy tests</strong>: These involve removing a small sample of tissue or cells from the body for examination under a microscope. This helps diagnose conditions such as cancer, infections, and autoimmune diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endoscopic tests</strong>: These use a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light source to visualize internal organs and tissues. These procedures can help diagnose conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and urinary system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electrode tests</strong>: These measure the electrical activity of the heart, brain, or neurons.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Functional tests</strong>: These assess the function of specific organs or systems in the body. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) evaluate lung function, audiometry assesses hearing, and stress tests evaluate heart function, among others.</p></li>
</ul>
