<h1 id="histamine-intolerance">Histamine intolerance</h1>
<p>Histamine intolerance is a condition in which an individual experiences a variety of symptoms in response to the consumption of foods or other substances that contain histamine or trigger the release of histamine in the body.</p>
<p>Histamine intolerance can be caused by various factors. It may result from a deficiency or dysfunction of the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO), which is responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive system. Other factors that can contribute to histamine intolerance include genetic predisposition, certain medical conditions, and the use of medications that interfere with histamine metabolism.</p>
<p>Symptoms usually occur shortly after consuming histamine-rich foods or beverages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Skin rashes or hives</li>
<li>Digestive problems (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea)</li>
<li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Asthma-like symptoms</li>
<li>Flushing</li>
<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>Anxiety or panic attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary management approach for histamine intolerance is dietary modification. This may involve avoiding or limiting histamine-rich foods and beverages.</p>
<p>Some individuals with histamine intolerance may also benefit from taking diamine oxidase (DAO) supplements, which can help break down histamine in the digestive system.</p>
<p>If an underlying medical condition or medication is contributing to histamine intolerance, addressing those factors may be necessary.</p>
