<h1 id="ozone-therapy">Ozone therapy</h1>
<p>Ozone therapy is a form of alternative medicine that involves the administration of ozone gas to the body for therapeutic purposes. Ozone (O3) is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, and it is known for its strong oxidizing properties.</p>
<p>Proponents of ozone therapy claim that it can be beneficial for various conditions, including chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal conditions. They believe that ozone therapy works by stimulating antioxidant defenses, improving circulation, modulating the immune system, and killing pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi).</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ozone Autohemotherapy</strong>: In this method, blood is withdrawn from the patient, mixed with ozone, and then reinfused into the bloodstream. It is believed to stimulate the immune system and improve oxygen delivery to tissues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ozone Insufflation</strong>: Ozone gas is introduced into body cavities, such as the rectum, vagina, or ears, to treat infections or inflammation in those areas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ozone Injection</strong>: Ozone gas is injected directly into joints, muscles, or other tissues to treat pain, inflammation, or degenerative conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ozone Sauna</strong>: This involves exposing the body to ozone gas in a sauna or steam cabinet, with the aim of detoxification and improving circulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ozonated Oils</strong>: Oils (e.g., olive oil, sunflower oil) are infused with ozone gas and used topically for wound healing, skin conditions, or as a nasal spray.</p></li>
</ul>
