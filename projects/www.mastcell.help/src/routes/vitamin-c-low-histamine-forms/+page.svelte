<p>For individuals with histamine intolerance or sensitivity, certain forms of vitamin C may be preferred as they are considered lower in histamine.</p>
<p><strong>Key forms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ascorbic Acid (Pure Vitamin C): Ascorbic acid is the most common and purest form of vitamin C. It is generally well-tolerated by individuals with histamine intolerance.</p></li>
<li><p>Sodium Ascorbate: Sodium ascorbate is a buffered form of vitamin C that is less acidic than ascorbic acid. It is often recommended for individuals who may experience stomach irritation with ascorbic acid.</p></li>
<li><p>Calcium Ascorbate: This is another buffered form of vitamin C that includes calcium. Like sodium ascorbate, it is less acidic and may be gentler on the stomach.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the above forms of vitamin C are generally considered lower in histamine, individual responses can vary, and itâ€™s advisable to introduce them cautiously to observe any potential reactions.</p>
