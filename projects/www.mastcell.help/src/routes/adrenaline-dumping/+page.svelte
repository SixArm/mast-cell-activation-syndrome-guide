<h1 id="adrenaline-dumping">Adrenaline dumping</h1>
<p>“Adrenaline dumping” is a colloquial term often used to describe the rapid release of <a href="/adrenaline/">adrenaline</a> (also known as epinephrine) into the bloodstream. Adrenaline is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the body’s “fight or flight” response to stress or danger. When the body perceives a threat, the adrenal glands release adrenaline to prepare the body for quick action.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fight or Flight Response</strong>: Adrenaline is released in response to stress, whether it be physical or psychological. It prepares the body to respond quickly to a perceived threat by increasing heart rate, dilating airways, redirecting blood flow to major muscle groups, and sharpening senses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Symptoms</strong>: Symptoms can include an increased heart rate, rapid breathing, heightened alertness, sweating, and dilated pupils.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Triggers</strong>: Triggers can include a sudden loud noise, a perceived threat, an intense emotional experience, or physical exertion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duration</strong>: The effects of adrenaline are usually short-lived, and the body returns to its normal state once the perceived threat or stressor is no longer present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chronic Stress</strong>: Chronic or repeated activation of the stress response can have negative effects on long-term health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Managing stress through relaxation techniques, mindfulness, regular exercise, and adequate sleep can help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medical Conditions</strong>: Conditions such as panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and certain anxiety disorders may involve an abnormal release of adrenaline.</p></li>
</ul>
