<p>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) can be challenging to diagnose because the symptoms can overlap with many other medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tryptase:</strong> Tryptase is an enzyme released by mast cells during activation. Elevated serum tryptase levels suggest mast cell activation. Elevated plasma tryptase levels may also be considered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plasma Histamine:</strong> Direct measurement of histamine levels in plasma can be performed. Elevated plasma histamine, especially during symptom flare-ups, support a diagnosis of MCAS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Histamine Metabolites:</strong> Histamine is broken down in the body, and measuring its metabolites, such as N-methylhistamine, in urine provide an indication of mast cell activity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2):</strong> Prostaglandin D2 is another mediator released by mast cells. Elevated levels in urine or blood suggest mast cell activation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plasma Chromogranin A:</strong> Chromogranin A is a protein released by neuroendocrine cells, including mast cells. Elevated levels may be associated with mast cell activation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cytokine Panel:</strong> Measurement of cytokines, such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), can provide insights into the inflammatory response associated with MCAS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Allergy Testing:</strong> Allergy tests, including skin prick tests and specific IgE blood tests, may help identify specific allergens triggering mast cell activation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Testing:</strong> Some individuals with MCAS may have genetic predispositions that affect their ability to regulate mast cell activity. Genetic testing for mutations may be considered.</p></li>
</ul>
