<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li><p><strong>Applicability</strong>: RRT can be used to address a wide range of psychological and emotional issues, including trauma, grief, relationship problems, self-esteem issues, performance anxiety, and more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brief and Solution-Focused</strong>: RRT is typically brief in duration, with many clients experiencing significant improvement or resolution of symptoms in just a few sessions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multimodal Approach</strong>: RRT incorporates elements from various therapeutic modalities, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), hypnosis, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), guided imagery, metaphorical storytelling, reframing, and more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: RRT is particularly effective in addressing trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, phobias, and other stress-related conditions.</p></li>
