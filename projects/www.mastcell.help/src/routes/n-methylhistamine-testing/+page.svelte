<h1 id="n-methylhistamine-testing">N-methylhistamine testing</h1>
<p>N-methylhistamine testing is a diagnostic tool used to measure the levels of N-methylhistamine in urine or blood. N-methylhistamine is a metabolite of histamine, a chemical released by mast cells during allergic and inflammatory responses. Elevated levels of N-methylhistamine may indicate increased histamine activity in the body, which can be associated with conditions such as mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of measuring N-methylhistamine is to assess the activity of mast cells. Mast cells release histamine, which is then metabolized in the body to form N-methylhistamine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> N-methylhistamine levels can be measured in urine or blood samples. Urine is often used for this test because histamine metabolites are excreted in the urine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Elevated levels of N-methylhistamine may suggest increased histamine activity, but like other mast cell mediator tests, the interpretation should be considered in context.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variations:</strong> In addition to measuring N-methylhistamine, healthcare providers may also consider evaluating other histamine metabolites to get a more comprehensive picture of mast cell activity.</p></li>
</ul>
