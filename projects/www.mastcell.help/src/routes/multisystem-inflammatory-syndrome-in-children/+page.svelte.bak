<p>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition. It is characterized by widespread inflammation affecting multiple organ systems in the body. MIS-C is currently linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), swollen hands and feet, swollen lymph nodes, irritability, decreased activity, difficulty breathing, chest pain, headache, confusion or altered mental status, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, severe abdominal pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Similarities</strong>: MIS-C shares some similarities with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome but has distinct features. It is characterized by severe inflammation, particularly in the blood vessels, and can lead to complications affecting the heart, kidneys, lungs, brain, and other organs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Use clinical signs and symptoms, along with laboratory tests to assess inflammation and organ function. Perform imaging studies, such as echocardiograms, to evaluate heart function and assess for other abnormalities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: May involve hospitalization to manage complications. This may include intravenous fluids, medications to reduce inflammation (such as corticosteroids), immunomodulatory therapies, and supportive care for affected organs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: The majority of children with the condition recover with appropriate treatment.</p></li>
