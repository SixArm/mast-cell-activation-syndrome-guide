<p>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that has been observed in children and adolescents. It is characterized by widespread inflammation affecting multiple organ systems in the body. MIS-C is currently linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Experts are still studying the cause of MIS-C and risk factors for getting it.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), swollen hands and feet, swollen lymph nodes, irritability, decreased activity, difficulty breathing, chest pain, headache, confusion or altered mental status, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, severe abdominal pain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Similarities</strong>: MIS-C shares some similarities with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome but has distinct features. It is characterized by severe inflammation, particularly in the blood vessels, and can lead to complications affecting the heart, kidneys, lungs, brain, and other organs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Based on a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, along with laboratory tests to assess inflammation and organ function. Doctors may also perform imaging studies, such as echocardiograms, to evaluate heart function and assess for other abnormalities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Typically involves hospitalization and supportive care to manage symptoms and complications. This may include intravenous fluids, medications to reduce inflammation (such as corticosteroids), immunomodulatory therapies, and supportive care for any affected organs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: Although MIS-C can be serious and require intensive medical management, the majority of children with the condition recover with appropriate treatment.</p></li>
