<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Allergic Conditions</strong>: Cromolyn sodium is primarily used for the prevention and treatment of allergic conditions, such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergies). It can help reduce symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and nasal congestion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asthma</strong>: Cromolyn sodium may also be used in the management of asthma, particularly exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mast Cell Stabilization</strong>: Cromolyn sodium works by stabilizing mast cells, which are a type of immune cell involved in allergic reactions, and by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Sedating</strong>: Cromolyn sodium does not typically cause drowsiness, making it suitable for use during the day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited Relief</strong>: Cromolyn sodium is generally used for prevention rather than providing immediate relief of acute symptoms. It may take some time to be effective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administration</strong>: Cromolyn sodium is available as nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis, eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis, and inhalation solutions for asthma.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safety</strong>: Cromolyn sodium is generally well-tolerated, and it has a low risk of causing adverse effects.</p></li>
