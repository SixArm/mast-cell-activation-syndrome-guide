<h1 id="essential-oil-caution">Essential oil caution</h1>
<p>Thanks to Manda Ferguson, cosmetic chemist.</p>
<p>There are 16 main sensitisers in essential oils that if not calculated properly can cause a lot of damage. Each essential oil can contain only a few or quite a lot of each. Each sensitiser has its own amount that can be used and then on top the total of each sensitiser has a topical dermal limit for leave on and wash off categories which then also falls under 9 main and more sub categories on which way they are applied and to which area of the body.</p>
<p>Never attempt to use essential oils yourself for topical use or to ingest.</p>
<p>Essential oils with diffusion are different, but donâ€™t have it running constantly.</p>
<p>Essential oils that can cause lung complaints in children under 12, so never have these around kids especially babies.</p>
