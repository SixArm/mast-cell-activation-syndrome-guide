<p>A serious medical condition can have significant impact on a person’s
health and quality of life. Support groups can be valuable resources for
individuals, as they provide a platform for sharing experiences, seeking
advice, and finding emotional support from others.</p>
<p>Here are some places to try…</p>
<ul>

HealthUnlocked, and RareConnect host various health communities where
people can connect, share information, and find support.</p></li>
<li><p>Online Forums and Social Media Groups: Many support groups exist
on popular social media platforms and health-related forums, such as
Reddit, Facebook, and X.</p></li>
<li><p>Patient Advocacy Organizations: Various patient advocacy and rare
disease organizations provide support for individuals. Examples include
The Mastocytosis Society and the Mast Cell Action Group.</p></li>
<li><p>Local Meetup Groups: Check websites like Meetup.com for local
support groups or rare disease support groups. These groups often
organize in-person meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare Provider Recommendations: Your healthcare provider may
be aware of local or online support groups. They can provide guidance on
finding appropriate resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Media Hashtags: You can use relevant hashtags on social
media platforms like X and Threads to connect with others. For example,
