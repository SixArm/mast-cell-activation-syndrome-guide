<p>A serious medical condition can have significant impact on a person’s
health and quality of life. Support groups can be valuable resources for
individuals, as they provide a platform for sharing experiences, seeking
advice, and finding emotional support from others.</p>
<p>Here are some places to try…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Online Health Communities</strong>: Websites and
platforms like Inspire, HealthUnlocked, and RareConnect host various
health communities where people can connect, share information, and find
support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online Forums and Social Media Groups</strong>: Many
support groups exist on popular social media platforms and
health-related forums, such as Reddit, Facebook, and X.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patient Advocacy Organizations</strong>: Various patient
advocacy and rare disease organizations provide support for individuals.
Examples include The Mastocytosis Society and the Mast Cell Action
Group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local Meetup Groups</strong>: Check websites like
Meetup.com for local support groups or rare disease support groups.
These groups often organize in-person meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healthcare Provider Recommendations</strong>: Your
healthcare provider may be aware of local or online support groups. They
can provide guidance on finding appropriate resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Media Hashtags</strong>: You can use relevant
hashtags on social media platforms like X and Threads to connect with
