<h1 id="electrolytes">Electrolytes</h1>
<p>Electrolytes are essential minerals or ions that have an electric charge and play a crucial role in various physiological processes within the human body. These ions are found in bodily fluids like blood, urine, and extracellular and intracellular fluids. Maintaining the right balance of these ions is crucial for overall health.</p>
<p>The most common electrolytes in the human body include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sodium (Na+)</strong>: Sodium is the primary extracellular cation and plays a key role in maintaining fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, and nerve function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potassium (K+)</strong>: Potassium is the primary intracellular cation and is essential for proper muscle function, nerve transmission, and maintaining heart rhythm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calcium (Ca2+)</strong>: Calcium is necessary for bone health, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and nerve function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Magnesium (Mg2+)</strong>: Magnesium is involved in various biochemical reactions, including muscle and nerve function, heart rhythm, and bone health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chloride (Cl-)</strong>: Chloride is often found alongside sodium and plays a role in maintaining electrolyte balance and regulating fluid levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bicarbonate (HCO3-)</strong>: Bicarbonate is a buffer that helps regulate the bodyâ€™s acid-base balance and pH.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phosphate (HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-)</strong>: Phosphate is vital for bone health, energy metabolism, and the formation of DNA and RNA.</p></li>
</ul>
