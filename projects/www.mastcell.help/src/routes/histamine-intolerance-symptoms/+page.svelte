<h1 id="histamine-intolerance-symptoms">Histamine intolerance:
symptoms</h1>
<p>Histamine intolerance is a condition characterized by an inability to
break down histamine efficiently, leading to an accumulation of this
compound in the body. Histamine is a naturally occurring substance
involved in various physiological processes, including the immune
response. When the body is unable to break down histamine properly, it
can lead to a range of symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms can vary
among individuals, and not everyone with histamine intolerance will
experience the same set of symptoms.</p>

<li><p><strong>Headaches and Migraines</strong>: Histamine can cause
blood vessels to dilate, leading to headaches and migraines in some
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flushing</strong>: Histamine can contribute to the
dilation of blood vessels, causing redness and flushing of the
skin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hives (Urticaria)</strong>: Raised, itchy welts or hives
