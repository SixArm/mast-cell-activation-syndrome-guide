<h1 id="sulfur-intolerance">Sulfur intolerance</h1>
<p>Sulfur intolerance, also known as sulfur sensitivity, is a condition in which an individual experiences adverse reactions to foods and substances containing sulfur or sulfites. Sulfur is a mineral that is naturally present in various foods and is an essential component of some amino acids and vitamins. However, some people may be sensitive or intolerant to sulfur-containing compounds, leading to a range of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Common symptoms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gastrointestinal symptoms</strong>: abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin symptoms</strong>: hives, itchy skin, eczema.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respiratory symptoms</strong>: coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, nasal congestion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other symptoms</strong>: headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, brain fog.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sulfur intolerance is distinct from sulfite sensitivity or sulfite allergy, which is a specific reaction to sulfites commonly found in processed foods and beverages. Sulfite sensitivity can cause asthma-like symptoms and is characterized by a more immediate and severe allergic response.</p>
