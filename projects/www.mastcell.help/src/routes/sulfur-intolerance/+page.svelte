<h1 id="sulfur-intolerance">Sulfur intolerance</h1>
<p>Sulfur intolerance, also known as sulfur sensitivity or sulfur
intolerance syndrome, is a condition in which an individual experiences
adverse reactions to foods and substances containing sulfur or sulfites.
Sulfur is a mineral that is naturally present in various foods and is an
essential component of some amino acids and vitamins. However, some
people may be sensitive or intolerant to sulfur-containing compounds,
leading to a range of symptoms.</p>
<p>Sulfur intolerance is distinct from sulfite sensitivity or sulfite
allergy, which is a specific reaction to sulfites commonly found in
processed foods and beverages. Sulfite sensitivity can cause asthma-like
symptoms and is characterized by a more immediate and severe allergic
response.</p>
<p>The exact cause of sulfur intolerance is not well understood, and it
is a relatively rare condition. It may result from an underlying
metabolic disorder that affects the bodyâ€™s ability to process
sulfur-containing compounds. Some people with sulfur intolerance find
relief by reducing their intake of sulfur-rich foods and avoiding foods
with added sulfites. However, it is essential to work with a healthcare
provider, allergist, or dietitian to properly diagnose and manage sulfur
intolerance and to ensure that the diet remains balanced and
nutritious.</p>
<p>Sulfur-containing compounds, such as sulfites, thiol groups, and
sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine and methionine, are found in
various foods and food additives. Sulfites are commonly used as
preservatives in foods and beverages, including dried fruits, wine, and
processed meats. Sulfur-containing amino acids are found in high-protein
foods like meat, eggs, and dairy products.</p>
