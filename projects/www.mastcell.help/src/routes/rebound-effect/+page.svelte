<h1 id="rebound-effect">Rebound effect</h1>
<p>The rebound effect, also known as rebound phenomenon or rebound response, refers to the recurrence or worsening of symptoms after the discontinuation or reduction of a medication or treatment. It often occurs when the body adapts to the effects of a medication, and upon discontinuation, there is a temporary exaggeration of symptoms or a return of symptoms that were previously suppressed.

<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Some medications can cause changes in physiological processes in the body, and when the medication is discontinued, the body may overreact as it readjusts to its normal state, leading to a rebound in symptoms. In some cases, the rebound effect is due to changes in neurological activity; for example, medications that affect neurotransmitter levels may lead to compensatory changes in the brain, and when the medication is suddenly stopped, these changes can result in a temporary increase in symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Nasal decongestant sprays, such as oxymetazoline, can cause rebound congestion. Sleep aids, such as benzodiazepines, can cause rebound insomnia. Topical corticosteroids used to reduce inflammation can cause rebound inflammation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Taper off gradually rather than stopped abruptly. This allows the body to adjust to the reduction in medication. In some cases, switching to alternative treatments with less risk of rebound effects may be advisable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patient Education</strong>: Patients should be informed about the potential for rebound effects when using certain medications and the importance of following prescribed dosages and tapering instructions.</p></li>
</ul>
