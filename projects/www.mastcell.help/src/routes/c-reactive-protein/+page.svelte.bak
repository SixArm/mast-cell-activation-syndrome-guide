<h1 id="c-reactive-protein-crp">C-reactive protein (CRP)</h1>
<p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker that measures the level of inflammation in the body. It is produced by the liver and released into the bloodstream in response to inflammation.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Role in Inflammation:</strong> CRP is part of the body’s natural response to inflammation. Inflammation can be caused by various factors, including infection, injury, autoimmune disorders, or chronic diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acute vs. Chronic Inflammation:</strong> CRP levels can rise rapidly in response to acute inflammation, such as an infection or injury. It can also be elevated in cases of chronic inflammation, which is often associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cardiovascular disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cardiovascular Risk:</strong> High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing is sometimes used to assess cardiovascular risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring Disease Activity:</strong> CRP levels can be used to monitor disease activity in conditions associated with inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Changes in CRP levels over time can help healthcare providers assess the effectiveness of treatment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normal Range:</strong> In healthy individuals, CRP levels are typically very low. However, levels can rise significantly in response to inflammation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations:</strong> While CRP is a valuable marker of inflammation, it does not provide specific information about the cause of inflammation. Additional tests and clinical evaluation are often necessary to determine the underlying condition.</p></li>
