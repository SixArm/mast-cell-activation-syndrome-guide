<h1 id="vitamin-b7-biotin">Vitamin B7 = Biotin</h1>
<p>Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is a water-soluble vitamin that
plays a crucial role in various metabolic functions within the body.
Biotin is essential for the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and
proteins. It also plays a role in maintaining healthy hair, skin, and
nails. Here are some key aspects of vitamin B7 (biotin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Metabolism</strong>: Biotin serves as a coenzyme in
several carboxylation reactions that are involved in the metabolism of
fats, carbohydrates, and certain amino acids. It assists enzymes in
breaking down substances for energy production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hair, Skin, and Nail Health</strong>: Biotin is often
associated with supporting healthy hair, skin, and nails. It is commonly
included in supplements targeting these areas due to its role in
maintaining their health.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cellular Growth</strong>: Biotin is important for normal
cell growth, which is necessary for the maintenance of healthy
tissues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pregnancy</strong>: Adequate biotin levels are crucial
during pregnancy for normal embryonic growth. However, pregnancy may
increase the need for biotin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blood Sugar Regulation</strong>: Some research suggests
that biotin might play a role in helping to maintain normal blood sugar
levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dietary sources of biotin include a variety of foods such as organ
meats (like liver and kidney), egg yolk, nuts, seeds, certain vegetables
(such as sweet potatoes and spinach), and some fruits (like avocados).
Bacteria in the gut also produce small amounts of biotin, contributing
to the bodyâ€™s overall supply.</p>
<p>Biotin deficiency is relatively rare but can occur, leading to
symptoms like hair loss, skin rash, and neurological issues. Certain
conditions or prolonged use of certain medications can interfere with
biotin absorption, potentially leading to deficiency. However, a
balanced diet that includes biotin-rich foods usually provides adequate
amounts of this essential vitamin for most people.</p>
