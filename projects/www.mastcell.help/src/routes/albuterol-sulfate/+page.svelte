It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta-agonists, specifically beta-2 adrenergic agonists. Brand names: ProAir, Proventil, Ventolinr.</p>
<p>Albuterol works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, which helps to open up the air passages and make breathing easier.

<p>Albuterol sulfate is available in various formulations, including metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), nebulizer solutions, and oral tablets. The choice of formulation depends on factors such as the severity of symptoms, patient preference, and healthcare provider recommendations.</p>
<p>Side effects of albuterol sulfate may include nervousness, tremor, palpitations, headache, dizziness, and throat irritation. These side effects are usually mild and temporary, but it’s essential to report any persistent or severe symptoms to a healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Albuterol sulfate is typically used on an as-needed basis for quick relief of symptoms. However, in some cases, it may also be used regularly to prevent or reduce the frequency of asthma attacks or COPD exacerbations. It’s important to use albuterol sulfate exactly as prescribed by a healthcare provider and to follow all instructions for proper use and administration.</p>
