<h1 id="lymphatic-system">Lymphatic system</h1>
<p>The lymphatic system is a network of tissues, organs, and vessels
that play a vital role in maintaining fluid balance, filtering harmful
substances, and supporting the body’s immune function. It complements
the circulatory system (blood vessels) and is responsible for the
circulation of lymph, a clear, colorless fluid that contains white blood
cells, known as lymphocytes, and other immune cells.</p>
<p>The lymphatic system works in close coordination with the circulatory
system and the immune system to help protect the body from infections
and maintain overall health. It serves as a crucial part of the body’s
defense against diseases and plays a role in maintaining the body’s
internal balance.</p>
<p>The primary functions of the lymphatic system include…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fluid Balance: One of the key roles of the lymphatic system is to
maintain fluid balance in the body. It does this by collecting excess
interstitial fluid (the fluid that surrounds cells) and returning it to
the bloodstream. This prevents the accumulation of excess tissue fluid,
which can lead to swelling and edema.</p></li>
<li><p>Immune Response: The lymphatic system is a crucial component of
the body’s immune defense. Lymph nodes, which are small, bean-shaped
structures located along lymphatic vessels, filter lymph and trap
foreign particles, such as bacteria, viruses, and abnormal cells.
Lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues are involved
in recognizing and attacking these foreign invaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Lymphatic Vessels: Lymphatic vessels, also called lymphatics, are
a network of thin-walled vessels that transport lymph throughout the
body. Lymphatic capillaries, which are even smaller than blood
capillaries, collect excess tissue fluid and transport it to larger
lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels ultimately merge to form the
thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, which return lymph to the
bloodstream.</p></li>
<li><p>Lymphatic Organs: The lymphatic system includes various lymphatic
organs, with the primary ones being lymph nodes, the spleen, the thymus,
and the tonsils. These organs house immune cells and play critical roles
in filtering and processing lymph.</p></li>
<li><p>Bone Marrow: While not traditionally considered a part of the
lymphatic system, the bone marrow is essential for the production of
white blood cells, including lymphocytes. These cells contribute to the
immune response and are circulated through the lymphatic
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Lymphatic System and Disease: Problems with the lymphatic system
can lead to conditions such as lymphedema, a swelling of body tissues
due to the accumulation of excess fluid; and various lymphatic system
cancers, including lymphomas.</p></li>
<li><p>Lymphatic System and Cancer: The lymphatic system is a common
route for the spread of cancer cells in the body. When cancer cells
break away from a tumor, they may enter lymphatic vessels and be
transported to nearby lymph nodes, where they can grow and form
secondary tumors.</p></li>
</ul>
