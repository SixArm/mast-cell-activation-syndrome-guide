<p>Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a medical condition characterized by a persistent and excessive inflammatory response in the body. It is often associated with exposure to mold, or mycotoxins, or other environmental factors.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Triggering Factors</strong>: CIRS is often triggered by exposure to biotoxins, such as mycotoxins produced by molds. Water-damaged buildings with mold growth are common sources of exposure. Other triggers may include Lyme disease and exposure to certain algae and bacteria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: CIRS can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, which may include fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), difficulty concentrating, memory problems, headaches, joint pain, respiratory issues, gastrointestinal problems, and sensitivity to light and sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormone Disruption</strong>: CIRS can affect the endocrine system, leading to hormonal imbalances. This may result in issues such as adrenal fatigue and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Predisposition</strong>: Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to CIRS. Specific genetic markers, such as HLA-DR, may play a role in determining susceptibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosis of CIRS involves a comprehensive evaluation of the patientâ€™s medical history, symptoms, and exposure history. Laboratory tests, including biomarkers associated with inflammation and immune system function, may be used in conjunction with clinical assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment of CIRS typically involves addressing the underlying environmental exposures, such as mold remediation. Additionally, a comprehensive approach may include supportive therapies, detoxification strategies, and medications to modulate the immune response.</p></li>
