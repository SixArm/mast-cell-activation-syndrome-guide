<p>Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) is a medical condition characterized by a persistent and excessive inflammatory response in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Triggers:</strong> CIRS is often triggered by exposure to biotoxins, such as mycotoxins produced by molds. Other triggers may include Lyme disease and exposure to certain algae and bacteria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> May include fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), difficulty concentrating, memory problems, headaches, joint pain, respiratory issues, gastrointestinal problems, and sensitivity to light and sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hormone Disruption:</strong> CIRS can affect the endocrine system, leading to hormonal imbalances. This may result in issues such as adrenal fatigue and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Predisposition:</strong> Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more susceptible to CIRS. Specific genetic markers, such as HLA-DR, may play a role in determining susceptibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treatment of CIRS typically involves addressing the underlying environmental exposures, such as mold remediation. Additionally, a comprehensive approach may include supportive therapies, detoxification strategies, and medications to modulate the immune response.</p></li>
