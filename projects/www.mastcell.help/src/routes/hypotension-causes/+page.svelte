<h1 id="hypotension-causes">Hypotension causes</h1>
<p>Hypotension (low blood pressure) has various potential causes and
types, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Orthostatic Hypotension: This occurs when blood pressure drops
suddenly when a person moves from a sitting or lying position to a
standing position. Common causes include dehydration, medication side
effects, and autonomic nervous system disorders.</p></li>
<li><p>Neurally Mediated Hypotension (NMH): This type of hypotension is
often associated with fainting (syncope) and can result from an abnormal
reflex response that causes blood pressure to drop during certain
activities or situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Postprandial Hypotension: A drop in blood pressure after eating,
which can affect some people, especially the elderly.</p></li>
<li><p>Severe Infections: Serious infections can lead to septic shock, a
condition characterized by dangerously low blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotension Due to Heart Problems: Certain heart conditions, such
as heart failure or bradycardia (slow heart rate), can result in low
blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Medications: Some medications, such as those used to treat high
blood pressure, may inadvertently cause low blood pressure as a side
effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Dehydration: A loss of fluids from the body can result in low
blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Anaphylaxis: A severe and potentially life-threatening allergic
reaction can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure.</p></li>
</ul>
