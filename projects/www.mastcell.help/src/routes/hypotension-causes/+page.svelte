<h1 id="hypotension-causes">Hypotension causes</h1>
<p>Hypotension (low blood pressure) has various potential causes and types, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Orthostatic Hypotension:</strong> This occurs when blood pressure drops suddenly when a person moves from a sitting or lying position to a standing position. Common causes include dehydration, medication side effects, and autonomic nervous system disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neurally Mediated Hypotension (NMH):</strong> This type of hypotension is often associated with fainting (syncope) and can result from an abnormal reflex response that causes blood pressure to drop during certain activities or situations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Postprandial Hypotension:</strong> A drop in blood pressure after eating, which can affect some people, especially the elderly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Severe Infections:</strong> Serious infections can lead to septic shock, a condition characterized by dangerously low blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypotension Due to Heart Problems:</strong> Certain heart conditions, such as heart failure or bradycardia (slow heart rate), can result in low blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medications:</strong> Some medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, may inadvertently cause low blood pressure as a side effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dehydration:</strong> A loss of fluids from the body can result in low blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anaphylaxis:</strong> A severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure.</p></li>
</ul>
