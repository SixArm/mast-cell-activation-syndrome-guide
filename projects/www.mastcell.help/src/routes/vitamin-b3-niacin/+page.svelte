<h1 id="vitamin-b3-niacin">Vitamin B3 = Niacin</h1>
<p>Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or nicotinic acid, is one of the
water-soluble B-vitamins that plays a crucial role in various metabolic
processes within the body. Niacin is involved in several important
functions, including energy production, DNA repair, and the maintenance
of healthy skin and nervous system. Here are some key aspects of vitamin
B3 (niacin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Energy Metabolism</strong>: Niacin is a key component of
the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are involved in a
wide range of metabolic reactions. These coenzymes play a vital role in
converting carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into energy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DNA Repair</strong>: Niacin is important for DNA repair
and synthesis, which is essential for the proper functioning and
replication of cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skin Health</strong>: Adequate niacin intake is necessary
for maintaining healthy skin. It can help improve skin conditions like
acne and reduce the risk of certain skin disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cardiovascular Health</strong>: Niacin is sometimes used
to manage cholesterol levels. It can raise high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol (often called “good” cholesterol) and lower
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (often called “bad”
cholesterol).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nervous System Function</strong>: Niacin is essential for
the proper functioning of the nervous system. Deficiency can lead to a
condition known as pellagra, which is characterized by neurological
symptoms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dietary sources of niacin include meat, poultry, fish, dairy
products, eggs, nuts, and legumes. It can also be synthesized in the
body from the amino acid tryptophan, although this process may not
provide sufficient niacin if dietary sources are inadequate.</p>
<p>Severe niacin deficiency can lead to pellagra, which presents with
symptoms like diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. However, pellagra is
rare in well-balanced diets. To prevent deficiency, it’s important to
consume foods rich in niacin as part of a healthy diet. In some cases,
niacin supplements may be recommended to treat specific health
conditions, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.</p>
