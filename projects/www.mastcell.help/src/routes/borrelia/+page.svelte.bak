<h1 id="borrelia">Borrelia</h1>
<p>Borrelia is a genus of bacteria belonging to the spirochete phylum. The most well-known species within this genus is Borrelia burgdorferi, which is responsible for causing Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lyme Disease</strong>: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Lyme disease can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans (a circular “bull’s-eye” rash), fever, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, and neurological symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transmission</strong>: Borrelia bacteria are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Primarily based on clinical symptoms, history of tick exposure, and laboratory testing, such as serological tests (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA, Western blot) to detect antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics, typically doxycycline, amoxicillin, or ceftriaxone, are crucial for successful management of Lyme disease and prevention of complications.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Chronic Lyme Disease Controversy</strong>: There is controversy surrounding the concept of chronic Lyme disease, which refers to persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease in patients who have received appropriate antibiotic treatment.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevention</strong>: Prevention of Lyme disease involves avoiding tick bites by using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, conducting tick checks after spending time outdoors, and removing ticks promptly and properly. Vaccines against Lyme disease have been developed but are not widely available or routinely recommended.</li>
</ul>
