<h1 id="mast-cell-stabilizers">Mast cell stabilizers</h1>
<p>Mast cell stabilizers are a type of medication used to prevent the degranualtion of mast cells, and thus mast cell release of histamine and many other chemicals. Mast cell stabilizers help in the treatment of <a href="/allergic-conjunctivitis/">allergic conjunctivitis</a>, <a href="/allergic-rhinitis/">allergic rhinitis</a>, <a href="/anaphylaxis/">analphylaxis</a>, <a href="/asthma/">asthma</a>, <a href="/mast-cell-activation-syndrome/">Mast Cell Activation Syndrome</a>, and other inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>Mast cell stabilizers are often recommended as first-line therapy for people with mild allergic conditions or for those who prefer not to use corticosteroids or antihistamines. However, they may not provide sufficient relief for more severe symptoms or acute allergic reactions, in which case other medications may be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Mast cell stabilizers work by preventing mast cells from releasing histamine and other inflammatory mediators when triggered by an allergen. By stabilizing mast cells, these medications help prevent the allergic response, including symptoms such as itching, swelling, and mucus production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effectiveness</strong>: Mast cell stabilizers are generally considered safe and effective for managing allergic conditions. However, they may take some time to provide full symptom relief and are often used as preventive rather than immediate treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Side effects of mast cell stabilizers are usually mild and can include irritation or burning at the application site (for eye drops or nasal sprays). Some people may experience a temporary bitter taste after using nasal sprays.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: These medications are typically used regularly, even when symptoms are not present, to prevent allergic reactions. They work best when used before exposure to allergens.</p>
