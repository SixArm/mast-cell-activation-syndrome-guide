(APS)</h1>
<p>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as Hughes syndrome, is an
autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid
antibodies in the blood. These antibodies can lead to abnormal blood
clotting in arteries and veins, as well as a range of other
symptoms.</p>
<p>APS can be primary, meaning it occurs on its own, or secondary, when
it is associated with another autoimmune disorder, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p>
<p>Diagnosing APS typically involves blood tests to detect the presence
of antiphospholipid antibodies, as well as confirming the clinical
criteria, which may include a history of blood clots or pregnancy
complications. Treatment aims to prevent blood clots and manage the
associated symptoms. This may involve anticoagulant medications, such as
warfarin or heparin, and other measures to reduce clotting risk.</p>
<p>Management of APS also involves addressing other health issues or
complications that may arise due to the syndrome, such as managing
cardiovascular disease or pregnancy-related concerns. Antiphospholipid
syndrome is a lifelong condition, and regular monitoring and medical
management are essential to reduce the risk of blood clots and
associated complications.</p>
<p>Key aspectsâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Antiphospholipid Antibodies: The hallmark of APS is the presence
of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. These antibodies can target
various phospholipids, a type of lipid molecule found in cell
membranes.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypercoagulability: People with APS are at an increased risk of
abnormal blood clot formation, both in the veins (venous thrombosis) and
arteries (arterial thrombosis). This can lead to conditions such as deep
vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, and heart
attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Pregnancy Complications: APS can cause pregnancy-related
complications, including recurrent miscarriages, stillbirths, and other
issues related to blood clotting in the placental circulation. This is
known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in pregnancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Neuropsychiatric Symptoms: Some individuals with APS may
experience neurological symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, and
cognitive disturbances.</p></li>
<li><p>Skin Issues: Skin manifestations can occur, including livedo
reticularis (a lacy, purplish discoloration of the skin) and skin
ulcers.</p></li>
<li><p>Cardiovascular Problems: APS can increase the risk of heart valve
disease, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular issues.</p></li>
