<h1 id="histamine-testing">Histamine testing</h1>
<p>Histamine testing is often done to assess the levels of histamine in the body, particularly in cases where there is suspicion of histamine intolerance or other conditions related to histamine regulation. Histamine is a chemical involved in several bodily functions, including the immune response, regulation of stomach acid, and neurotransmission.</p>
<p><strong>Common methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blood Plasma Histamine Test:</strong> Blood is drawn, and the sample is analyzed to determine if histamine levels are within the normal range.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blood Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Activity Test:</strong> DAO is an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the body. A blood test can measure the activity of DAO, and low DAO activity may suggest an inability to effectively break down histamine, potentially contributing to histamine intolerance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urine Test:</strong> Some tests measure histamine and its metabolites in urine. Elevated levels in urine may suggest an excess of histamine in the body.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provocation Test:</strong> A patient is given a controlled dose of histamine, usually through injection or ingestion, and their response is observed.</p></li>
</ul>
