<h1 id="histamine-bucket">Histamine bucket</h1>
<p>The “histamine bucket” theory is the idea that each person has a histamine threshold for how much histamine their bodies can tolerate. If the histamine exceeds the threshold, then the “histamine bucket overflows”, which causes symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cumulative Effect</strong>: The concept of the histamine bucket emphasizes that it’s not just the histamine content of a single food item that matters; rather, it’s the cumulative effect of histamine from various sources throughout the day that “fill the histamine bucket”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Enzyme</strong>: The body relies on enzymes like diamine oxidase (DAO) to break down histamine. These enzymes work to “drain the histamine bucket”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Individual Variability</strong>: Individuals have different tolerance levels for histamine. Some people may have a larger histamine bucket and can tolerate higher levels, while others may have a smaller histamine bucket and may be more sensitive to lower amounts of histamine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Symptoms of histamine intolerance can vary but may include headaches, migraines, hives, itching, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea), and respiratory symptoms (such as nasal congestion).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Management</strong>: Managing histamine intolerance often involves identifying and avoiding high-histamine foods, addressing any underlying issues affecting DAO function, and working with healthcare professionals to develop an individualized plan.</p></li>
</ul>
