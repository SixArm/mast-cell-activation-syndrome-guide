<h1 id="nortriptyline">Nortriptyline</h1>
<p>Nortriptyline is a medication primarily used to treat depression. It belongs to a class of drugs known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Nortriptyline works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine, in the brain, which can help improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression. Nortriptyline may also be prescribed for chronic pain and anxiety disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timing</strong>: Like other antidepressants, nortriptyline may not produce noticeable effects immediately. It may take several weeks for the full therapeutic effect to be achieved. Itâ€™s essential to continue taking the medication as prescribed, even if symptoms improve, unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side effects</strong>: Dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, dizziness, weight gain, changes in appetite, difficulty urinating, sexual dysfunction, sweating, fatigue. Serious side effects are less common but may include increased heart rate (tachycardia), irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia), changes in blood pressure, seizures, suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in young adults).</p></li>
</ul>
