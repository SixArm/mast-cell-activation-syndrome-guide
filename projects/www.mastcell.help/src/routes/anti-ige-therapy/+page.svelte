<h1 id="anti-ige-therapy">Anti-IgE therapy</h1>
<p>Anti-IgE therapy is a type of biologic medication used to treat allergic conditions, particularly allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives). It works by targeting and blocking immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody that plays a central role in allergic reactions.</p>
<p>In allergic individuals, IgE antibodies bind to allergens such as pollen, pet dander, or certain foods, triggering the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, hives, wheezing, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Anti-IgE medication, such as <a href="/omalizumab/">omalizumab</a>, binds to IgE antibodies circulating in the blood, preventing them from attaching to mast cells and basophils, which are involved in the allergic response. By blocking IgE, omalizumab reduces the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, thereby alleviating allergic symptoms.</p>
<p>Anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab has been shown to be effective in reducing asthma exacerbations, improving asthma control, and reducing the need for oral corticosteroids in people with allergic asthma. It has also been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of hives in people with chronic idiopathic urticaria.</p>
