<h1 id="asthma-medications">Asthma medications</h1>
<p><a href="../asthma/">Asthma</a> often involves a combination of medications, some for immediate relief (i.e. rescue medications/), and some for long-term management of inflammation (i.e. controller medications).</p>
<p><strong>Common types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs)</strong>: These bronchodilators provide quick relief by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways. They treat acute symptoms and are known as rescue medications. Examples: Albuterol, Levalbuterol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABAs)</strong>: These bronchodilators provide long-term asthma control. They are often prescribed in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for individuals with persistent asthma. Examples: Salmeterol, Formoterol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)</strong>: These reduce airway inflammation. They are controller medications to prevent symptoms. Examples: Fluticasone, Budesonide, Beclomethasone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oral Corticosteroids</strong>: Oral corticosteroids for short periods can control severe asthma exacerbations. Long-term use is avoided due to the risk of side effects. Examples: Prednisone, Prednisolone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leukotriene Modifiers</strong>: These block the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators. They are controller medications, especially for exercise-induced asthma or allergic rhinitis. Examples: Montelukast, Zafirlukast.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mast Cell Stabilizers</strong>: These prevent the release of histamine and inflammatory substances from mast cells. They are controller medications, especially for exercise-induced asthma. Examples: Cromolyn, Nedocromil.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monoclonal Antibodies</strong>: These are biologic medications for severe asthma that target components of the immune system. Examples: Omalizumab, Mepolizumab, Dupilumab, Benralizumab.</p></li>
</ul>
