(TCM)</h1>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a comprehensive and ancient
system of medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years in
China and other parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>TCM is founded on a holistic understanding of the human body,
emphasizing the interconnectedness of physical, mental, and emotional
well-being. It uses concepts such as Yin and Yang, the Five Elements
(Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), and the flow of Qi to diagnose and
treat health issues.</p>
<p>Key aspects…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acupuncture: Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin needles
into specific points on the body to stimulate and balance the flow of
vital energy, known as “Qi” or “Chi”.</p></li>
<li><p>Herbal Medicine: TCM employs a wide array of medicinal herbs and
natural substances to create herbal remedies.</p></li>

nutrition in maintaining health. It classifies foods based on their
energetic qualities and their potential to harmonize the body’s
energy.</p></li>
<li><p>Cupping Therapy: Cupping involves the use of heated glass or
plastic cups placed on the skin to create suction. This is believed to
improve blood circulation, relieve muscle tension, and promote
healing.</p></li>

involves various manual techniques to stimulate acupressure points,
promote energy flow, and alleviate musculoskeletal issues.</p></li>
