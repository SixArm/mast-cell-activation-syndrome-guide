<p>The anti-IgE IgG test, also known as anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing, is a laboratory test used to measure the levels of IgG antibodies directed against IgE antibodies in the bloodstream. This test is often performed in the context of evaluating allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, particularly those mediated by IgE antibodies.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: The provider collects a blood sample from the patient, which is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. In the lab, the sample is tested for the presence and quantity of IgG antibodies specific to IgE antibodies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allergic Diseases</strong>: Elevated levels of anti-IgE IgG antibodies may be associated with allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis. The presence of these antibodies may reflect an attempt by the immune system to regulate or counteract the effects of IgE-mediated allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autoimmune Disorders</strong>: Elevated levels of anti-IgE IgG antibodies have also been reported in certain autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune urticaria (chronic hives) or autoimmune thyroiditis. In these conditions, the immune system mistakenly targets self-antigens, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immunomodulatory Therapies</strong>: The anti-IgE IgG test may also be used to monitor the efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies targeting IgE-mediated allergic responses. For example, in patients receiving anti-IgE monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., omalizumab), measuring anti-IgE IgG antibodies over time can help assess treatment response and guide clinical management.</p></li>
