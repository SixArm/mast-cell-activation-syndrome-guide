<p>Dietary supplements are products designed to provide nutrients that help a personâ€™s health. Dietary supplements are available in various forms, such as pills, capsules, powders, liquids, and gummies.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vitamins</strong>: These are essential organic compounds that your body needs to function properly. Examples are vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and the B-complex vitamins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minerals</strong>: These are inorganic elements that are vital for bodily functions. Examples are calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Amino Acids</strong>: These are the building blocks of proteins. Some amino acids are considered essential because the body cannot produce them, so they must be obtained from the diet.</p></li>
