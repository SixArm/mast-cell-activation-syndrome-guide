<h1 id="copper">Copper</h1>
<p>Copper is an essential trace element that is important for various physiological processes in the human body. While copper is required in very small amounts, it plays a critical role in functions such as the formation of red blood cells, connective tissue, and the central nervous system.</p>
<p><strong>Key aspects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dietary Sources</strong>: Copper is naturally present in a variety of foods, including organ meats (liver, kidney), seafood (especially oysters and crab), nuts (especially cashews), seeds, whole grains, legumes, and certain fruits and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults</strong>: 900 micrograms (0.9 milligrams) per day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficiency</strong>: Copper deficiency is rare in well-balanced diets but can occur in certain situations. Symptoms of copper deficiency can include anemia, bone abnormalities, and neurological issues. Medical conditions that can lead to copper deficiency include celiac disease, Menkes disease (a genetic disorder), and conditions that affect the absorption of copper in the digestive tract.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toxicity</strong>: Excessive copper intake can lead to toxicity, resulting in symptoms such as gastrointestinal distress, liver and kidney damage, and neurological problems. Overconsumption of copper is typically associated with contaminated water or exposure to copper from other sources.</p></li>
</ul>
