<p>Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) testing is a diagnostic tool used to measure the levels of prostaglandin D2, a type of signaling molecule, in biological samples such as blood or urine. Elevated levels of PGD2 may indicate increased activity of mast cells, which are immune cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. This testing is particularly relevant in the context of conditions associated with mast cell disorders, such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).</p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Purpose: The primary purpose of measuring PGD2 is to assess the activation of mast cells. Mast cells release various mediators, including prostaglandins, during immune responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Conditions for Testing: PGD2 testing is often ordered when there is suspicion of mast cell disorders, particularly in cases where other mast cell mediators like tryptase are inconclusive. Symptoms may include skin reactions, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory symptoms, and anaphylaxis.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedure: PGD2 levels can be measured in blood or urine samples. Blood is typically drawn from a vein in the arm or, in the case of urine, collected over a specific period. The samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation: Elevated levels of PGD2 may suggest increased mast cell activity. Like serum tryptase, the interpretation of PGD2 levels needs to be considered in the context of clinical symptoms and other diagnostic information.</p></li>
<li><p>Variations: PGD2 is one of several prostaglandins produced by the body. In addition to measuring PGD2, healthcare providers may also consider evaluating other prostaglandins to get a more comprehensive picture of mast cell activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitations: While PGD2 testing can provide valuable information, it is not a standalone diagnostic tool. The interpretation of results should consider the patientâ€™s clinical presentation, medical history, and other relevant diagnostic tests.</p></li>
</ul>
