<h1 id="allergic-reactions">Allergic reactions</h1>
<p>Allergic reactions can vary in their severity and presentation. They are categorized into several types based on their clinical features and mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Main types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Type I Hypersensitivity (Immediate Hypersensitivity)</strong>: These are rapid and immediate allergic reactions that occur when an allergen interacts with IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Examples: Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, anaphylaxis, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type II Hypersensitivity (Cytotoxic Hypersensitivity). Mechanism</strong>: In these reactions, antibodies (IgG or IgM) bind to antigens on the surface of cells, leading to cell destruction by complement activation or phagocytosis. Examples: Hemolytic transfusion reactions, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and certain drug-induced immune reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type III Hypersensitivity (Immune Complex-Mediated Hypersensitivity)</strong>: Immune complexes, formed by the interaction of antigens and antibodies (IgG or IgM), deposit in tissues and cause inflammation by activating complement and attracting immune cells. Examples: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and some drug reactions like serum sickness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type IV Hypersensitivity (Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity)</strong>: This type of reaction is cell-mediated and involves T cells, not antibodies. It typically develops over hours to days after exposure to the allergen. Examples: Contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy or poison oak), tuberculosis skin test reactions, and graft rejection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type V Hypersensitivity (Stimulatory Hypersensitivity)</strong>: In this rare type, antibodies stimulate receptor function rather than blocking it. Examples: Gravesâ€™ disease, in which autoantibodies stimulate thyroid hormone production by binding to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mixed Hypersensitivity. Mechanism</strong>: This category can involve a combination of different hypersensitivity mechanisms. Examples: Some immune responses in autoimmune diseases may involve both type II and type III hypersensitivity mechanisms.</p></li>
</ul>
