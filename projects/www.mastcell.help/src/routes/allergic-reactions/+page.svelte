<h1 id="allergic-reactions">Allergic reactions</h1>
<p>Allergic reactions can vary in their severity and presentation, and
they are categorized into several types based on their clinical features
and mechanisms. Here are the main types of allergic reactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type I Hypersensitivity (Immediate Hypersensitivity). Mechanism:
These are rapid and immediate allergic reactions that occur when an
allergen interacts with IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and
basophils, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory
mediators. Examples: Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, anaphylaxis,
allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergies.</p></li>
<li><p>Type II Hypersensitivity (Cytotoxic Hypersensitivity). Mechanism:
In these reactions, antibodies (IgG or IgM) bind to antigens on the
surface of cells, leading to cell destruction by complement activation
or phagocytosis. Examples: Hemolytic transfusion reactions, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, and certain drug-induced immune reactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Type III Hypersensitivity (Immune Complex-Mediated
Hypersensitivity). Mechanism: Immune complexes, formed by the
interaction of antigens and antibodies (IgG or IgM), deposit in tissues
and cause inflammation by activating complement and attracting immune
cells. Examples: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and
some drug reactions like serum sickness.</p></li>
<li><p>Type IV Hypersensitivity (Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity).
Mechanism: This type of reaction is cell-mediated and involves T cells,
not antibodies. It typically develops over hours to days after exposure
to the allergen. Examples: Contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy or
poison oak), tuberculosis skin test reactions, and graft
rejection.</p></li>
<li><p>Type V Hypersensitivity (Stimulatory Hypersensitivity):
Mechanism: In this rare type, antibodies stimulate receptor function
rather than blocking it. Examples: Graves’ disease, in which
autoantibodies stimulate thyroid hormone production by binding to
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors.</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed Hypersensitivity. Mechanism: This category can involve a
combination of different hypersensitivity mechanisms. Examples: Some
immune responses in autoimmune diseases may involve both type II and
type III hypersensitivity mechanisms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that the classification of allergic reactions
into these types helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms, but
in clinical practice, allergic reactions can have overlapping features
and may not always fit neatly into one category. The severity of
allergic reactions can also vary, from mild symptoms like itching and
sneezing to severe, life-threatening conditions such as anaphylaxis.
Proper diagnosis and management of allergic reactions are crucial, and
individuals with known allergies often develop personalized action plans
with healthcare professionals to address their specific needs.</p>
