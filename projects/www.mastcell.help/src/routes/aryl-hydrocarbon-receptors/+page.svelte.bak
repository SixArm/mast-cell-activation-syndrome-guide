<h1 id="aryl-hydrocarbon-receptors-ahr">Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR)</h1>
<p>Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) are transcription factors that play a critical role in the bodyâ€™s response to environmental toxins, specifically aromatic hydrocarbons. AhR activation is involved in regulating the expression of a wide range of genes.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ligand Activation:</strong> AhRs are typically inactive in the absence of ligands. They become activated when they bind to specific ligands, many of which are environmental pollutants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Xenobiotic Metabolism:</strong> AhR activation induces the expression of enzymes involved in xenobiotic (foreign substance) metabolism. This helps the body process and eliminate potentially harmful substances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detoxification:</strong> AhRs regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are essential for detoxifying and breaking down a wide range of chemicals, including drugs and toxins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immune Regulation:</strong> AhRs are involved in immune system regulation and have been linked to the development of immune cells and immune responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Development and Tissue Homeostasis:</strong> AhRs play a role in various developmental processes, including cardiovascular development, and are implicated in maintaining tissue homeostasis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Talk with Other Pathways:</strong> AhRs can interact with other cellular signaling pathways, including those involved in inflammation and oxidative stress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nutrition and Diet:</strong> Some dietary compounds, such as those found in cruciferous vegetables, can activate AhRs and have been associated with potential health benefits.</p></li>
