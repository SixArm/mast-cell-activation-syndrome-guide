<p>Alcaftadine is an antihistamine medication used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the conjunctiva (the thin membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids) due to allergies. It is available in eye drop form.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: Alcaftadine blocks the action of histamine during an allergic reaction. Histamine causes itching, redness, and swelling, associated with allergies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>: Alcaftadine eye drops treat symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as itching, redness, tearing, and swelling of the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side Effects</strong>: Eye irritation, burning or stinging sensation in the eyes, dry eyes, and headache. These side effects are usually mild and temporary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precautions</strong>: If you wear contact lenses, you should remove them before using the eye drops and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them. Also, inform your doctor if you have any other eye conditions or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p></li>
