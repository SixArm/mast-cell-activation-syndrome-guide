<p>Garlic adds a lot of flavour to our meals, but it could also add a lot of problems to your life. If you suffer from an allergy rather than an intolerance, expect to see hives, itching in your mouth and throat, a runny nose, sneezing, and stomach cramps.</p>
<p>Garlic is cross-reactive. Meaning if youâ€™re allergic, you should also be wary of onions, leeks, chives, and shallots.</p>
