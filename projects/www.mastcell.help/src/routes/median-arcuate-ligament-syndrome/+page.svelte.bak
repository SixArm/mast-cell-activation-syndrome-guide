<p>Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), also known as celiac artery compression syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by compression of the celiac artery and nearby nerves by the median arcuate ligament (MAL), a fibrous band of tissue that connects the diaphragm to the spine. This compression can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and weight loss, particularly after eating.</p>
<p><strong>Ke points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anatomy</strong>: The median arcuate ligament is located at the level of the diaphragm where the aorta and celiac artery pass through. In some individuals, the MAL may exert pressure on the celiac artery and the surrounding nerves, causing symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: The most common symptom of MALS is chronic, postprandial (after eating) abdominal pain, often described as a dull ache or cramping. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, and an audible bruit (abnormal sound) over the abdomen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Diagnosing MALS can be challenging as its symptoms overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, imaging studies (such as CT angiography or duplex ultrasound), and sometimes diagnostic injections to confirm the compression of the celiac artery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Treatment of MALS aims to relieve the compression of the celiac artery and alleviate symptoms. Conservative management includes dietary modifications, pain management, and lifestyle changes. For individuals with severe symptoms or those who do not respond to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be necessary; this typically involves division of the median arcuate ligament to release the compression on the celiac artery, known as median arcuate ligament release.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prognosis</strong>: The prognosis for MALS varies depending on the severity of symptoms and the individualâ€™s response to treatment. Many individuals experience significant improvement or resolution of symptoms following surgical intervention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complications</strong>: If left untreated, MALS can lead to complications such as malnutrition due to poor dietary intake and chronic pain that affects quality of life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong>: MALS should be distinguished from other causes of abdominal pain, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or other vascular disorders.</p></li>
