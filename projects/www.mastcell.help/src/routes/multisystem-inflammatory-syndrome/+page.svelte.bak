<p>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) is a rare and severe medical condition characterized by significant inflammation in multiple organ systems.</p>
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Relationship to COVID-19:</strong> MIS is believed to be a post-infectious complication of COVID-19. It typically occurs several weeks after a COVID-19 infection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Common clinical features of MIS include persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, red eyes (conjunctivitis), swollen lymph nodes, and cardiac abnormalities such as inflammation of the heart muscles (myocarditis) or coronary artery dilation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnostic Criteria:</strong> Tests looks for elevated inflammatory markers, and evidence of recent or current SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure. Imaging studies may assess organ involvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treatment often involves hospitalization, and may include medications to reduce inflammation (such as intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids), as well as interventions to manage specific organ system involvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, most individuals with MIS recover, although the severity and duration of symptoms can vary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> While the exact cause of MIS remains the subject of ongoing research, vaccination against COVID-19 is considered a key preventive measure.</p></li>
