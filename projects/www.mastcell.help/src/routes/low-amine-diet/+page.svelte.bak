<h1 id="low-amine-diet">Low-amine diet</h1>
<p>A low-amine diet is a dietary approach that restricts foods high in amines, which are compounds naturally present in certain foods. Amines include substances like histamine, tyramine, and phenylethylamine, which can accumulate in certain foods as they age, ferment, or are processed.</p>
<p>Some people may follow a low-amine diet to manage symptoms associated with conditions such as histamine intolerance or certain types of migraines.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Avoid High-Amine Foods</strong>: This includes aged or fermented foods such as aged cheeses (such as cheddar, Parmesan), cured meats (such as salami, pepperoni), fermented foods (such as sauerkraut, kimchi), and certain alcoholic beverages (such as red wine, beer).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fresh is Best</strong>: Opt for fresh foods over processed or aged ones. Fresh meats, poultry, fish, fruits, and vegetables are typically lower in amines compared to their aged or processed counterparts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be cautious with leftovers</strong>: Leftover foods, especially those that have been stored for a few days, can accumulate higher levels of amines. It’s generally best to consume foods fresh rather than as leftovers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read Labels</strong>: Check food labels for ingredients that may contain amines or trigger symptoms. This includes additives like monosodium glutamate (MSG), which can be high in free glutamate, a type of amine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Individual Tolerance</strong>: Everyone’s tolerance to amines can vary. Some individuals may be able to tolerate small amounts of high-amine foods, while others may need to strictly avoid them.</p></li>
</ul>
