<p>Gupta Program Brain Retraining refers to a program designed to address symptoms related to conditions often characterized by persistent fatigue and other associated symptoms. The program is developed by Ashok Gupta, a medical researcher.</p>
<p>The Gupta Program incorporates elements of neuroplasticity and mind-body techniques to address the impact of chronic stress on the brain and the body. It is based on the hypothesis that conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) are associated with a dysfunctional stress response and an overactive amygdala, a part of the limbic system that is involved in processing emotions.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Amygdala Retraining</strong>: Focus on calming the amygdala, which is believed to be involved in perpetuating the symptoms of conditions like CFS and ME.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mind-Body Techniques</strong>: Techniques such as meditation, mindfulness, and visualization are often included to promote relaxation and reduce stress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cognitive Restructuring</strong>: Participants may engage in cognitive exercises to challenge and change negative thought patterns associated with their symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graded Exposure</strong>: Gradual exposure to stimuli that may trigger symptoms is sometimes incorporated to help individuals gradually increase their tolerance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breathing Exercises</strong>: Techniques to promote diaphragmatic breathing and relaxation.</p></li>
</ul>
