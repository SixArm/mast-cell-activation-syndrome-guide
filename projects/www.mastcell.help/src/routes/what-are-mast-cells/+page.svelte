<h1 id="what-are-mast-cells">What are mast cells?</h1>
<p>Mast cells are a type of white blood cell that is an essential part
of the immune system. These specialized cells are found in various
tissues throughout the body, especially in areas that are in close
contact with the external environment, such as the skin, respiratory and
gastrointestinal tracts, and blood vessels.</p>
<p>Mast cells are crucial for the bodyâ€™s ability to respond to and
defend against various threats, but their inappropriate activation or
excessive responses can lead to health issues, such as Mast Cell
Activation Syndrome (MCAS).</p>
<p>Key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Granules: Mast cells contain granules filled with various
bioactive molecules, including histamine, heparin, proteases, and
cytokines. These granules store and release these substances upon
activation.</p></li>
<li><p>Allergic Response: When exposed to allergens, mast cells become
activated and release histamine. Histamine is a key mediator in allergic
responses and can cause allergy symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Inflammation: When activated, they release various cytokines and
chemotactic factors that can recruit other immune cells to the site of
inflammation, helping to coordinate the immune response.</p></li>
<li><p>Immune Surveillance: Mast cells are involved in the early
detection of potential threats, including allergens, toxins, and
pathogens. They serve as a first line of defense in the immune
system.</p></li>
<li><p>Wound Healing: Mast cells contribute to the process of wound
healing and tissue repair. They release growth factors and cytokines
that can aid in tissue regeneration.</p></li>
<li><p>Heparin Production: Mast cells contain heparin, an anticoagulant
(blood-thinning) substance. This is important for preventing excessive
blood clot formation in areas of inflammation.</p></li>
