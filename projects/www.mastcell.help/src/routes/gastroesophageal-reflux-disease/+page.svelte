Disease (GERD)</h1>
<p>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a chronic medical condition
that occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus.
The esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth
to the stomach. When the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a ring of
muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, doesn’t function properly, it can
allow stomach acid to reflux, or flow backward, into the esophagus. This
can lead to various symptoms and potential complications.</p>
<p>Long-term, untreated GERD can lead to complications, such as erosive
esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus lining), Barrett’s esophagus
(changes in the lining that can increase the risk of esophageal cancer),
and narrowing of the esophagus (stricture).</p>
<p>GERD can often be managed with lifestyle and dietary changes, as well
as over-the-counter or prescription medications, which reduce stomach
acid production or provide a protective barrier for the esophagus. In
some cases, surgery may be considered to strengthen the LES.</p>
<p>Common symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Heartburn: A burning sensation in the chest or throat, often
after eating, which is the hallmark symptom of GERD.</p></li>
<li><p>Regurgitation: The sensation of stomach contents coming back into
the mouth or throat.</p></li>
<li><p>Acid Indigestion: Discomfort in the upper abdomen.</p></li>
<li><p>Chest Pain: Chest pain that may be mistaken for a heart-related
issue. It’s important to distinguish GERD-related chest pain from
heart-related chest pain, so a healthcare provider should be
consulted.</p></li>
<li><p>Difficulty Swallowing: Known as dysphagia, this can occur due to
damage to the esophagus from chronic acid exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic Cough: Some people with GERD experience a persistent
cough.</p></li>
<li><p>Sore Throat: Frequent acid exposure can lead to throat irritation
and a sore throat.</p></li>
<li><p>Laryngitis: Inflammation of the voice box, which can cause
hoarseness.</p></li>
<li><p>Asthma: GERD can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms in some
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Dental Problems: Frequent exposure to stomach acid can lead to
tooth decay and other dental issues.</p></li>
</ul>
