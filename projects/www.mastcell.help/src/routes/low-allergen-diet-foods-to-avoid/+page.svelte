<p>For a low-allergen diet, here are items to avoid or limit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foods known to be common allergens, often referred to as the “big eight”. These include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Highly Allergenic Ingredients</strong>: Avoid foods containing highly allergenic ingredients like casein, lactose, gluten, and soy derivatives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processed and Prepackaged Foods</strong>: Many processed and prepackaged foods can contain hidden allergens. It’s advisable to focus on whole, unprocessed foods to minimize exposure to hidden allergens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Artificial Additives</strong>: Some food additives, such as artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, can trigger allergic reactions or intolerances in some individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Contamination</strong>: Be vigilant about cross-contamination, which can occur when allergenic foods come into contact with other foods or food preparation surfaces. This is especially important for people with severe allergies.</p></li>
</ul>
