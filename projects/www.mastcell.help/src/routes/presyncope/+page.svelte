<h1 id="presyncope">Presyncope</h1>
<p>Presyncope is a medical term used to describe the feeling of
lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness that can occur when a person is
on the verge of losing consciousness. If someone experiences presyncope,
it’s essential to take it seriously, because fainting can result in
injury, and in some cases, it may be a sign of an underlying medical
condition that requires treatment.</p>
<p>Common symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Paleness of the skin</li>
<li>Feeling weak or unsteady</li>
<li>Tunnel vision or blurred vision</li>
<li>A sensation of “floating”</li>
<li>Rapid or irregular heart rate (palpitations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Presyncope can be caused by a variety of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthostatic Hypotension: A sudden drop in blood pressure when
transitioning from lying down to standing up.</li>
<li>Dehydration: A lack of fluid in the body can lead to low blood
pressure and reduced blood flow to the brain.</li>
<li>Vasovagal Syncope: A reflex triggered by emotional stress, pain, or
fear that leads to a drop in blood pressure and fainting.</li>
<li>Heart Conditions: Various heart problems, such as arrhythmias or
structural issues, can result in presyncope.</li>
<li>Medications: Some medications can cause low blood pressure or other
side effects that lead to presyncope.</li>
<li>Anemia: A reduced number of red blood cells can impair oxygen
delivery to the brain.</li>
<li>Hyperventilation: Rapid, shallow breathing can alter the balance of
oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, leading to dizziness and
faintness.</li>
</ul>
