<p>Stomach acid is necessary for digestion. The parietal cells of the stomach produce hydrochloric acid, the main constituent of gastric juice. Hydrochloric acid breaks down the food we eat, and kills pathogenic bacteria, and prompts the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gall bladder.</p>
<p>Having too little stomach acid or too much stomach acid can cause some similar symptoms: acid reflux, heartburn and pain, belching, nausea. The symptoms feel similar, even though the causes are opposite.</p>
<p>You can try a quick home test to see if you have enough stomach acid. Dissolve a quarter teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in a little water and drink it on an empty stomach. If you have enough stomach acid, then you should experience belching within approximately 5 minutes. If you don’t have enough stomach acid, then nothing notable will happen.</p>
<p>If you think you have low stomach acid, you can help yourself by eating slowly and chewing well. You can ask a health food store for a hydrochloric acid supplement or digestive bitters.</p>
<p>If you think you have enough stomach acid, and also you’re having symptoms, then that’s when stomach acid reducer medications are helpful. Common stomach acid reducers include antihistamine H2-blockers (e.g. famotidine/Pepcid, cimetidine/Tagamet) and proton pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole/Prilosec, lansoprazole/Prevacid).</p>
<p>Some doctors and some people (including me) believe that stomach acid reducers are vastly overused, because the doctors believe many peoples’ symptoms are caused by low stomach acid, not high stomach acid. This is why it’s so important for gastointestinal patients to get a stomach acid test. The person needs to find out if the stomach acid is too low, or too high, or normal. If stomach acid is too low, then discontinue stomach acid reducers.</p>
<p>However, with histamine-related disorders, such as serious allergies, histamine intolerance (HI), mast cell disorders (MCDs) in general, and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) specifically, there’s a given that histamine is much too high and causing symptoms and reactions.</p>
<p>The high histamine makes it a good guess that stomach acid is too high due to high histamine hitting the stomach H2 receptors. So people try H2-blockers, and feel relief. This is known as test-of-treatment i.e. try a medication, and if it works, then that helps confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p>The missing step: many doctors recommend H2-blockers, but skip the stomach acid test. People who are experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms should ask their doctors for the stomach acid test. People who are experiencing histamine-related disorders, or taking H2-blockers or PPIs, should ask their doctors about these medications.</p>
