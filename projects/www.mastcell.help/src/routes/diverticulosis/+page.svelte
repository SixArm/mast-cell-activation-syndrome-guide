<h1 id="diverticulosis">Diverticulosis</h1>
<p>Diverticulosis is a common condition characterized by the presence of small, bulging pouches (diverticula) that can form in the lining of the digestive system, typically in the colon (large intestine). These pouches can develop when weak spots in the wall of the colon give way under pressure. Diverticulosis itself usually does not cause noticeable symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prevalence</strong>: Diverticulosis becomes more common with age, and it is more prevalent in industrialized countries where diets are typically lower in fiber.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Factors</strong>: low-fiber diet, older age, potential genetic predisposition, lack of physical activity, and obesity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complications</strong>: The diverticula can become inflamed or infected, leading to a condition called diverticulitis. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: A colonoscopy may be used to visualize the colon and identify the presence of diverticula. A CT scan can provide detailed images of the colon and help diagnose diverticulosis or complications like diverticulitis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Fiber supplements or stool softeners may be recommended to help manage symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Consume a high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Stay hydrated. Get regular exercise. Maintain a healthy weight.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Antibiotics</strong>: If diverticulitis occurs and is associated with infection, antibiotics may be prescribed.</p></li>
</ul>
