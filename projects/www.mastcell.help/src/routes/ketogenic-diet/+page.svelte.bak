<h1 id="ketogenic-diet">Ketogenic diet</h1>
<p>The ketogenic diet, a.k.a. keto diet, is a low-carbohydrate medium-protein high-fat diet. The goal is to induce ketosis, which shifts the bodyâ€™s energy source from carbohydrates and glucose to fat and ketones.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Low Carbohydrates</strong>: The ketogenic diet focuses on a large reduction in carbohydrate intake. Carbohydrates are restricted to a level that induces and maintains ketosis, such as 20 grams per day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Moderate Protein</strong>: Protein intake is moderate and is adjusted based on activity level, muscle mass, and health goals. Consuming too much protein can interfere with ketosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High Fat</strong>: The diet is high in healthy fats, providing the majority of daily caloric intake. This includes sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, oils, and fatty cuts of meat.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Weight Loss</strong>: The reduction in carbohydrate intake and the shift to using stored fat for energy can contribute to weight loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blood Sugar Control</strong>: People with diabetes or insulin resistance may experience improved blood sugar control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Mental Clarity</strong>: Some individuals report increased mental clarity and focus when in ketosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced Hunger</strong>: The satiating effect of fats and the stabilization of blood sugar levels may lead to reduced feelings of hunger.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Therapeutic Uses</strong>: The ketogenic diet has potential therapeutic benefits in certain medical conditions, such as histamine-related conditions and neurodegenerative disorders.</p></li>
</ul>
