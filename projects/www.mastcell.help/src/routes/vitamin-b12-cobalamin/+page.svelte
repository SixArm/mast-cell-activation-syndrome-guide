<h1 id="vitamin-b12-cobalamin">Vitamin B12 = Cobalamin</h1>
<p>Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble B-vitamin that plays a critical role in a variety of essential bodily functions. Cobalamin is unique among the B-vitamins because it contains cobalt, a mineral that is vital for its structure and function. Here are some key aspects of vitamin B12 (cobalamin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DNA Synthesis</strong>: Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. It is required for the formation of new cells and is particularly important for the production of red blood cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Red Blood Cell Formation</strong>: Cobalamin is crucial for the maturation and proper functioning of red blood cells. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia, characterized by abnormally large and poorly functioning red blood cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nervous System Health</strong>: Vitamin B12 is essential for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. It plays a role in the formation of the myelin sheath, which insulates and protects nerve cells, aiding in proper nerve conduction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy Metabolism</strong>: Cobalamin is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It helps convert food into energy, contributing to overall metabolic function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methyl Group Transfer</strong>: Vitamin B12 is essential for the transfer of methyl groups in various biochemical reactions. This is important for various processes, including the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deficiency</strong>: It can lead to a range of symptoms, including anemia, fatigue, neurological problems, and potentially irreversible nerve damage if left untreated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dietary sources of vitamin B12 include animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is not found in plant-based foods, so vegetarians and vegans need to obtain B12 from fortified foods or supplements. The human body can store vitamin B12 in the liver for several years, so deficiency is relatively rare but can occur.</p>
