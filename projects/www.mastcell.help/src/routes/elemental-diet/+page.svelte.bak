<h1 id="elemental-diet">Elemental diet</h1>
<p>An elemental diet is a specialized form of medical nutrition therapy that involves consuming a liquid formula containing essential nutrients in their simplest form. This type of diet is designed to provide complete nutrition that is easy to digest. Elemental diets are often used for specific medical conditions or situations where normal food intake is challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Complete Nutrition</strong>: The formula is carefully formulated to provide all essential nutrients, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple Nutrients</strong>: The elemental diet formula contains nutrients in their elemental or pre-digested form. This means that proteins are broken down into amino acids, fats into fatty acids, and carbohydrates into simple sugars. This enables the digestive system to rest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liquid Form</strong>: Elemental diets are typically administered in a liquid form. This liquid formula can be consumed orally or, in some cases, delivered through a feeding tube when oral intake is not feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Medical Conditions</strong>: Elemental diets are often used in the management of specific medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohnâ€™s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and certain gastrointestinal disorders. They may also be used as a short-term intervention for conditions that require temporary bowel rest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elimination Diet</strong>: In some cases, an elemental diet is used as part of an elimination diet strategy to identify and manage food sensitivities or allergies. By providing a formula with predigested nutrients, potential triggers for adverse reactions are eliminated.</p></li>
</ul>
