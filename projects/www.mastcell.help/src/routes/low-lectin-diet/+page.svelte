<h1 id="low-lectin-diet">Low-lectin diet</h1>
<p>A low-lectin diet is a dietary approach that restricts the intake of foods high in lectins, which are naturally occurring proteins found in a variety of plant-based foods. Lectins serve various functions in plants, including defense against pests and pathogens. While lectins are not inherently harmful to most people when consumed in normal amounts, some individuals may choose to reduce their dietary lectin intake due to concerns about potential adverse effects on health.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foods to choose</strong>: non-nightshade vegetables, most fruits, certain dairy products (e.g. butter, ghee), eggs, meat, poultry, fish.</li>
</ul>
<p>High lectin foods include legumes, grains, nightshade vegetables, squash, A1 dairy, conventionally raised meat</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foods to avoid</strong>: legumes (e.g. beans, lentils, peas), many grains (e.g. wheat, barley, rye), nightshades (e.g. tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants), certain fruits (e.g. bananas, avocados), A1 milk and many A1 dairy products, some nuts and seeds (e.g. peanuts, cashews, sunflower seeds), certain grains and pseudograins (e.g. quinoa, oats, rice).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s essential to emphasize that a strict low-lectin diet can be quite restrictive, potentially limiting the intake of various nutritious foods. If you are considering a low-lectin diet, it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian who can provide guidance, ensure that your dietary choices meet your nutritional needs, and monitor your progress. Additionally, it’s important to be mindful of the potential consequences of eliminating entire food groups from your diet, as this can affect overall dietary balance and health.</p>
