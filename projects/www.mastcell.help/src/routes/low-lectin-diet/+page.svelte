<h1 id="low-lectin-diet">Low-lectin diet</h1>
<p>A low-lectin diet is a dietary approach that restricts the intake of
foods high in lectins, which are naturally occurring proteins found in a
variety of plant-based foods. Lectins serve various functions in plants,
including defense against pests and pathogens. While lectins are not
inherently harmful to most people when consumed in normal amounts, some
individuals may choose to reduce their dietary lectin intake due to
concerns about potential adverse effects on health.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the evidence regarding the health impact
of lectins in the diet is mixed, and more research is needed to fully
understand their effects on human health. Some proponents of low-lectin
diets claim that reducing lectin consumption can lead to improved
digestive health and overall well-being. However, scientific consensus
on this topic is limited, and the potential benefits of a low-lectin
diet are still a subject of debate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Foods to choose</strong>: non-nightshade vegetables, most
fruits, certain dairy products (e.g. butter, ghee), eggs, meat, poultry,
fish.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foods to avoid</strong>: legumes (e.g. beans, lentils,
peas, many grains (e.g. wheat, barley, rye), nightshades (e.g. tomatoes,
potatoes, eggplants), certain fruits (e.g. bananas, avocados), milk and
many dairy products, some nuts and seeds (e.g. peanuts, cashews,
sunflower seeds), certain grains and pseudograins (e.g. quinoa, oats,
rice).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s essential to emphasize that a strict low-lectin diet can be
quite restrictive, potentially limiting the intake of various nutritious
foods. If you are considering a low-lectin diet, it’s advisable to
consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian who can
provide guidance, ensure that your dietary choices meet your nutritional
needs, and monitor your progress. Additionally, it’s important to be
mindful of the potential consequences of eliminating entire food groups
from your diet, as this can affect overall dietary balance and
health.</p>
